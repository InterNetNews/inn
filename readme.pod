=head1 What is INN?

INN (InterNetNews), originally written by Rich Salz, is a very full-featured
and extremely flexible and configurable Usenet / Netnews news server.  For a
complete description of the protocols behind Usenet and Netnews, see S<RFC
3977> (NNTP), S<RFC 4642> updated by S<RFC 8143> (TLS/NNTP), S<RFC 4643> (NNTP
authentication), S<RFC 4644> (streaming NNTP feeds), S<RFC 5536> (USEFOR),
S<RFC 5537> (USEPRO), S<RFC 6048> (NNTP LIST additions), S<RFC 8054> (NNTP
compression) and S<RFC 8315> (Cancel-Lock) or their replacements.

In brief, Netnews is a set of protocols for exchanging messages between
a decentralized network of news servers.  News articles are organized
into newsgroups, which are themselves organized into hierarchies.
Each individual news server stores locally all articles it has received
for a given newsgroup, making access to stored articles extremely fast.
Netnews does not require any central server; instead, each news server
passes along articles it receives to all of the news servers it peers
with, those servers pass the articles along to their peers, and so on,
resulting in "flood fill" propagation of news articles.

A news server performs three basic functions: it accepts articles from
other servers and stores them on disk, sends articles it has received out
to other servers, and offers stored news articles to readers on demand.
It additionally has to perform some periodic maintenance tasks, such as
deleting older articles to make room for new ones.

Originally, a news server would just store all of the news articles it had
received in a file system.  Users could then read news by reading the
article files on disk (or more commonly using news reading software that
did this efficiently).  These days, news servers are almost always
stand-alone systems and news reading is supported via network connections.
A user who wants to read a newsgroup opens that newsgroup in their
newsreader software, which opens a network connection to the news server
and sends requests for articles and related information.  The protocol
that a newsreader uses to talk to a news server and that a news server
uses to talk to another news server over TCP/IP is called NNTP (Network
News Transport Protocol).

INN supports accepting articles via either NNTP connections or via UUCP.
B<innd>, the heart of INN, handles NNTP feeding connections directly;
UUCP newsfeeds use B<rnews> (included in INN) to hand articles off to
B<innd>.  Other parts of INN handle feeding articles out to other news
servers, most commonly B<innfeed> (for real-time outgoing feeds) or
B<nntpsend> and B<innxmit> (used to send batches of news created by B<innd>
to a remote site via TCP/IP).  INN can also handle outgoing UUCP feeds.

The part of INN that handles connections from newsreaders is B<nnrpd>.

Also included in INN are a wide variety of supporting programs to handle
periodic maintenance and recovery from crashes, process special control
messages, maintain the list of active newsgroups, and generate and record
a staggering variety of statistics and summary information on the usage
and performance of the server.

INN also supports an extremely powerful filtering system that allows the
server administrator to reject unwanted articles (such as spam and other
abuses of Usenet).

INN is free software, supported by Internet Systems Consortium and
volunteers around the world.  See L<"Supporting the INN Effort"> below.

=head1 Prerequisites

Compiling INN requires an S<ANSI C> compiler (B<gcc> is recommended).  INN was
originally written in S<K&R C>, but supporting pre-ANSI compilers has become
enough of a headache that a lot of the newer parts of INN will no longer
compile with a non-ANSI compiler.  B<gcc> itself will compile with most
vendor non-ANSI compilers, however, so if you're stuck with one,
installing B<gcc> is highly recommended.  Not only will it let you build INN,
it will make installing lots of other software much easier.  You may also
need GNU B<make> (particularly if your system B<make> is BSD-derived), although
most SysV B<make> programs should work fine.  Compiling INN also currently
requires a B<yacc> implementation (B<bison> will do fine).

INN uses GNU B<autoconf> to probe the capabilities of your
system, and therefore should compile on nearly any Unix
system.  It does, however, make extensive use of mmap(),
which can cause problems on some older operating systems.  See
L<INSTALL|https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/docs-2.7/install.html>
for a list of systems it is known to work on.  If you encounter problems
compiling or running INN, or if you successfully run INN on a platform
that isn't listed in F<INSTALL>, please let us know (see L<"Reporting
Bugs"> below).

S<Perl 5.8.0> or later is required to build INN, run several subsystems,
and use the embedded Perl filtering and authentication hook support (which is
highly recommended; some excellent spam filters have been written for INN).
Depending on what language you want to write your filters and authentication
hooks in, you may also want to install S<Python 2.3.0> or later, or S<Python
3.3.0> or later.

For support for authenticated control messages, you will need either PGP
or GnuPG, the latter being recommended.  See F<INSTALL> for more details.

For the C<ovdb> overview storage method, you'll need S<Berkeley
DB 4.4> or later (4.7 or later recommended).  For the C<ovsqlite>
overview storage method, you'll need S<SQLite 3.8.2> or later (3.20.0
or later recommended).  If you have zlib available, you can also compress
overview before it's stored into C<ovdb> or C<ovsqlite>, and enable the
COMPRESS capability, an NNTP extension.  For support for news reading
over TLS, you'll need OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  To support SASL authentication
to B<nnrpd> or to feed newsgroups to an IMAP server with SASL
authentication, you'll need the Cyrus SASL libraries.  INN can also
check passwords against a Kerberos KDC; for this, you will need Kerberos
libraries.

=head1 Getting Started

A news server can be a fairly complicated piece of software to set up just
because of the wide variety of pieces that have to be configured (who is
authorized to read from the server, what newsgroups it carries, and how
the articles are stored on disk at a bare minimum, and if the server isn't
completely stand-alone S<-- and> very few servers S<are --> both incoming and
outgoing feeds have to be set up and tested).  Be prepared to take some
time to understand what's going on and how all the pieces fit together.
If you have any specific suggestions for documentation, or comments about
things that are unclear, please send them to the INN maintainers (see
L<"Reporting Bugs"> below).

=head2 Download

Source code tarballs of the official releases can be downloaded from
L<https://downloads.isc.org/isc/inn/>.  The InterNetNews project does
not distribute releases in binary form.  Yet, precompiled versions may
exist on your operating system.

When installing a new INN server, you may wish to download the latest
snapshot of the stable branch rather than the last official release,
so that to pick up possible bug fixes.

=head2 Build and Install

See
L<INSTALL|https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/docs-2.7/install.html>
for step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring a news
server.

=head2 Documentation

INN also comes with a very complete set of man pages; there is a man page
for every configuration file and program that comes with INN.  (If you
find one that doesn't have a man page, that's a bug.  Please do report
it.)  When trying to figure out some specific problem, reading the man
pages for all of the configuration files involved is a very good start.

URL: L<https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/docs-2.7/> (online
documentation)

=head1 Reporting Bugs

We're interested in all bug reports.  Not just on the programs, but on the
documentation too.  Please use the GitHub issue tracker to send such bug
reports, or alternatively send them to

    inn-workers@lists.isc.org

(patches are certainly welcome, see below).  Even if you post to Usenet,
please CC the above address.

If you have general "how do I do this" questions or problems configuring
your server that you don't believe are due to a bug in INN, you should
post them to news.software.nntp.  A lot of experienced INN users,
including several of the INN maintainers, read that newsgroup regularly.
Please don't send general questions to the above addresses; those
addresses are specifically for INN, and the INN maintainers usually won't
have time to answer general questions.

=head1 Testing and Development

=head2 Source Code

INN is maintained using the Git version control system.
The official InterNetNews Git repository is located at
L<https://github.com/InterNetNews/inn>.  A local copy of the current
development source can be obtained by cloning it using a Git client:

    git clone https://github.com/InterNetNews/inn.git

You can also download L<daily
snapshots|https://archives.eyrie.org/software/inn/snapshots/> produced
only if the current code compiles and passes the test suite, so they
have undergone at least some basic validation, although they've not
been tested by a human.

=head2 Contributing Code

If you have a patch or a utility that you'd like to be considered for
inclusion into INN, please make a GitHub pull request, or alternatively
mail it to

    inn-workers@lists.isc.org

in the body of the message (not as an attachment because the mailing-list
might strip it), or put it on a webpage and send a link.  Patches included
with a bug report as described above should follow the same procedure.

Please submit all patches against the current main branch, not against a
stable release.  The development version of INN is often much different
than the last stable release.

Also please take a look at
L<HACKING|https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/docs-2.7/hacking.html>
for information about development and coding style.

Have fun!

=head1 Mailing Lists

There are various INN-related mailing lists you can join or send messages
to if you like.  Some of them you must be a member of before you can send
mail to them (thank the spammers for that policy), and one of them is
read-only (no postings allowed).

=head1 Who's Responsible / Who to Thank

See
L<CONTRIBUTORS|https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/inn/docs-2.7/contributors.html>
for a long list of past contributors as well as people from the
inn-workers mailing list who have dedicated a lot of time and effort to
getting this new version together.  They deserve a big round of applause.
They've certainly got our thanks.

This product includes software developed by UUNET Technologies, Inc. and
by the University of California, Berkeley and its contributors.

Last, but certainly not least, Rich Salz, the original author of INN
deserves a lion's share of the credit for writing INN in the first place
and making it the most popular news server software on the planet (no NNTP
yet to the moon, but we plan to be there first).

=head1 Related Packages

INN users may also be interested in the following software packages that
work with INN or are based on it.  Please note that none of this software
is developed or maintained by ISC; we don't support it and generally can't
answer questions about it.

=over 4

=item Cleanfeed

URL: L<https://www.mixmin.net/cleanfeed/> (maintained by Steve Crook)

Cleanfeed is an extremely powerful spam filter, probably the most widely
used spam filter on Usenet currently.  It catches excessive multiposting
and a host of other things, and is highly configurable.  Note that it
requires that INN be built with Perl support (the B<--with-perl> option to
configure).

Cleanfeed was originally developed by Jeremy Nixon who maintained it
until 1998.  Then Marco d'Itri until 2002.  Steve Crook has been
maintaining it since 2007.

A Python-based variant of Cleanfeed, named PyClean, also exists and
can be found at L<https://github.com/crooks/PyClean>.

=item GUP (Group Update Program)

URL: L<https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gup>

GUP provides a way for your peers to update their F<newsfeeds> entries as
they want without having to ask you to edit the configuration file all the
time.  It's useful when feeding peers take limited and very specific
feeds that change periodically.

=item innduct

URL:
L<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ian/git-manpage/innduct.git/innduct.8>
(maintained by Ian Jackson)

A possible replacement for B<innfeed>, B<innxmit> and B<nntpsend>
that quickly and reliably streams Usenet article to a remote site.
B<innduct> is designed to be robust and not to lose any articles (when
offered to peers) in case it unexpectedly dies, contrary to B<innfeed>.
It also permits a realtime feed, contrary to B<innxmit> or B<nntpsend>.

=item NewsPortal

URL: L<https://gitlab.com/yamo-nntp/newsportal>

A PHP-based web news reader that works as a front-end to a regular news
server such as INN and lets people read and post without learning a news
reader.

NewsPortal was originally written by Florian Amrhein
L<https://amrhein.eu/newsportal/doc/> and is now maintained by Stéphane
Grégoire who notably did a great job fixing a few bugs and adapting
it for use on smartphones.

=item PersonalINN

URL: L<http://www.ritual.org/summer/pinn/>

PersonalINN is a version of INN modified for personal use and with a
friendly GUI built on top of it.  It is available for NEXTSTEP or OPENSTEP
only, unfortunately.

=item suck

URL: L<https://github.com/lazarus-pkgs/suck>

B<suck> is a separate package for downloading a news feed via a reading
connection (rather than via a direct NNTP or UUCP feed) and sending
outgoing local posts via POST.  It's intended primarily for personal or
small-organization news servers who get their news via an ISP and are too
small to warrant setting up a regular news feed.

=back

=head1 Supporting the INN Effort

Note that INN is supported by Internet Systems Consortium, and although it
is free for use and redistribution and incorporation into vendor products
and export and anything else you can think of, it costs money to produce.
That money comes from ISPs, hardware and software vendors, companies who
make extensive use of the software, and generally kind-hearted folk such
as yourself.

Internet Systems Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP server
implementation and handles the official support/release of BIND.  You can
learn more about the ISC's goals and accomplishments from the web page at
L<https://www.isc.org/>.
