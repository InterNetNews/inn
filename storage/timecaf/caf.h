** Then the table of free blocks.  The table is FreeZoneTabSize bytes
** long.  First comes a "first-level" or "index" bitmap, taking up the
** space from the end of the CAFHEADER to the end of the first
** block, i.e. FreeZoneIndexSize.  The rest of the table is a big bitmap
** listing free blocks in the 'data' portion of the CAF file.
**
** In the "index" bitmap: LSB of bitmap byte 0 is 1 if there are any 1s
** (free blocks) listed in the first block of the big bitmap, and 0 if there
** are no 1s in that block.  The remaining bits of the index bitmap
** correspond to the remaining blocks of the big bitmap accordingly.
** The idea is that from the index bitmap one can tell which part of the
** main bitmap is likely to have free blocks w/o having to read the entire
** main bitmap.
**
** As for the main bitmap, each bit is 1 if the corresponding data
** block (BlockSize bytes) is free.  LSB of bitmap byte 0 corresponds
** to the block @ offset StartDataBlock, and all the rest follow on
** accordingly.
**
** Note that the main part of the bitmap is *always* FreeZoneIndexSize*8
** blocks long, no matter how big the CAF file is.  The table of free blocks
** is almost always sparse.  Also note that blocks past EOF in the CAF file
** are *not* considered free.  If the CAF article write routines fail to
** find free space in the free block bitmaps, they will always attempt to
** extend the CAF file instead.

** keep the bitmap size and StartBlockOffset together with the bitmap
** w/o having keep passing the original CAFHEADER to every routine
** that wants it.  The bitmap structure contains the first (index) bitmap,
** as well as pointers to structures for each block of the main bitmap that
** has been read into memory.
