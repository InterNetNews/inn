# simpleftp - Rudimentary FTP client.
#
# Author: David Lawrence <tale@isc.org>.
#         Rewritten by Julien Elie to use Net::FTP.
#
# Fetch files to the local machine based on URLs on the command line.
# INN's configure searches for ncftp, wget, linx, et caetera,
# but they're all system add-ons, so this is provided.
#
# Perl 5 is already required by other parts of INN; it only took a half hour
# to write this, so this was the easiest way to go for a backup plan.
#
# This script is nowhere near as flexible as libwww.  If you really need
# that kind of power, get libwww and use it.  This is just sufficient for what
# INN needed.
