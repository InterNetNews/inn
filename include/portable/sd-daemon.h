/*
 * Portability wrapper around systemd-daemon headers.
 *
 * Currently, only sd_is_socket, sd_listen_fds, sd_notify, and sd_notifyf are
 * guaranteed to be provided by this interface.  This takes the approach of
 * stubbing out these functions if the libsystemd-daemon library is not
 * available, rather than providing a local implementation, on the grounds
 * that anyone who wants systemd status reporting should be able to build with
 * the systemd libraries.  In particular, sd_is_socket always returns false
 * and does not perform its intended function.
 *
 * The stubs for sd_notify and sd_notifyf provided as functions, rather than
 * using #define, to allow for the variadic function and to avoid compiler
 * warnings when they are used without assigning the return value as is
 * recommended in the sd_notify(3) man page.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
