   Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any
   purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above

Some specific portions of INN are covered by different licenses.  Those
licenses, if present, will be noted prominantly at the top of those source
files.  Specifically (but possibly not comprehensively):

   backends/send-uucp.in and control/perl-nocem.in are under the GNU
   General Public License version 2 or later.  See doc/GPL for a copy of
   the GPL v2.

   backends/shrinkfile.c, frontends/scanspool.in, lib/alloca.c, lib/concat.c,
   lib/inet_aton.c, lib/inet_ntoa.c, lib/memcmp.c, lib/pread.c, lib/pwrite.c,
   lib/setenv.c, lib/seteuid.c, lib/strlcat.c and lib/strlcpy.c are in
   the public domain.

   lib/snprintf.c may be used for any purpose as long as the author's
   notice remains intact in all source code distributions.

   control/pgpverify.in and control/signcontrol.in are under a BSD-style
   license (with the advertising clause) with UUNET Technologies, Inc. as
   the copyright holder.  See the end of those files for details.

   control/controlchan.in and control/modules/*.pl are covered by a
   two-clause BSD-style license (no advertising clause).  See the
   beginning of those files for details.

   lib/strcasecmp.c, lib/strspn.c, and lib/strtok.c are taken from BSD
   sources and are covered by the standard BSD license.  See those files
   for more details.

   lib/md5.c is covered under the standard free MD5 license from RSA Data
   Security.  See the file for more details.  A clarification is also
   provided here:  <http://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/RSA-MD-all>.

      "Implementations of these message-digest algorithms, including
      implementations derived from the reference C code in RFC-1319,
      RFC-1320, and RFC-1321, may be made, used, and sold without
      license from RSA for any purpose."

   history/his.c and history/hisv6/hisv6.c are under a license very
   similar to the new BSD license (no advertising clause) but with Thus
   plc as the copyright holder.  See those files for details.

   lib/tst.c, include/inn/tst.h and doc/pod/tst.pod are derived from
   <http://www.octavian.org/cs/tst1.3.tar.gz> and are under the new BSD
   license (no advertising clause), but with Peter A. Friend as the
   copyright holder.

   tests/runtests.c is covered under a license very similar to the MIT/X
   Consortium license.  See the beginning of the file for details.

Note that all portions of INN that link with core INN code have to be
covered by licenses compatible with the license at the top of this file,
and since INN links with several external libraries if so configured (such
as OpenSSL), should also be compatible with the licenses of those external
libraries to be safe.  Some portions of this distribution are covered by
more restrictive licenses, but all of that code is completely stand-alone,
either as a standalone script or as code that compiles into a separate
executable.

Please note that the files in the contrib directory are not properly part
of INN and may be under widely varying licenses.  Please see each file
and/or its documentation for license information.
