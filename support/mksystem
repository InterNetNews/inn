##  Create include/inn/system.h from include/config.h.
##
##  include/config.h is generated by autoconf and contains all of the test
##  results for a platform.  Most of these are only used when building INN,
##  but some of them are needed for various definitions in the header files
##  for INN's libraries.  We want to be able to install those header files
##  and their prerequisites, but we don't want to define the normal symbols
##  defined by autoconf since they're too likely to conflict with other
##  packages.
##
##  This script takes the path to awk as its first argument and the path to
##  include/config.h as its second argument and generates a file suitable
##  for being included as <inn/system.h>.  It contains only the autoconf
##  results needed for INN's API, and the symbols that might conflict with
##  autoconf results in other packages have INN_ prepended.
