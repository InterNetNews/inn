.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.I cvtbatch
[
.BI \-w " items"
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Cvtbatch
reads standard input as a sequence of lines, converts each line, and
writes it to standard output.
It is used to convert simple batchfiles that contain just the article
name to INN batchfiles that contain additional information about each
article.
.PP
Each line is taken as a storage API token indicating a Usenet article.
(Only the first word of each line is parsed; anything following
whitespace is ignored.  Lines not starting with a valid token are also
silently ignored.)
.PP
If the input file consists of a series of Message-ID's, then use
.IR grephistory (1)
with the `\fB`\-s\fP'' flag piped into
.IR cvtbatch .
.SH OPTIONS
