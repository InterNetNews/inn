.IX Title "SM 1"
.TH SM 1 "2004-03-06" "INN 2.5.0" "InterNetNews Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
sm \- Command\-line interface to the INN storage manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBsm\fR [\fB\-dHiqRrS\fR] [\fItoken\fR ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \s-1INN\s0 storage manager is the subsystesm that stores and keeps track of
all of the articles and what storage backend they're in.  All stored
articles are assigned a storage \s-1API\s0 token.  \fBsm\fR is a command-line
interface to that storage manager, primarily used to retrieve articles by
those tokens but also to perform other operations on the storage
subsystem.
.PP
\&\fItoken\fR is the token of an article (the same thing that's returned by
\&\fBgrephistory\fR or stored in the history file).  It looks something like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @0502000005A4000000010000000000000000@
.Ve
.PP
Any number of tokens can be given on the command line for any function
other than \fB\-s\fR.  If none are, \fBsm\fR normally reads tokens from standard
input, one per line.  The default operation is to retrieve and write to
standard output the corresponding article for each token given.
.PP
If \fB\-s\fR is given, \fBsm\fR instead stores the article given on standard
input (in native format, not wire format) using the standard rules of the
storage subsystem.  If the article is stored successfully, the token of
the article is printed to standard output.  Please note that this does not
make any attempt to write a history entry or any overview data, and is
therefore only useful under very specific circumstances.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, -r"
Rather than retrieving the specified article, remove the article.  This
will delete the article out of the news spool and it will not subsequently
be retrievable by any part of \s-1INN\s0.  It's equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`ctlinnd cancel\*(C'\fR
except it takes a storage \s-1API\s0 token instead of a message \s-1ID\s0.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
Retrieve only the header of the article rather than the entire article.
This option cannot be used with \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-i\fR, or \fB\-S\fR.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Show the newsgroup name and article number associated with the token
rather than the article itself.  Note that for crossposted articles, only
the first newsgroup and article number to which the article is associated
will be returned.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
Suppress all error messages except usage errors.
.IP "\fB\-R\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R"
Display the raw article.  This means that line endings won't be converted
to native line endings and will be left as \s-1CRLF\s0 sequences, leading periods
will still be escaped for sending over \s-1NNTP\s0, and the article will end in
a \s-1CRLF\s0.CRLF sequence.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Write the article to standard output in the format used by rnews spool
files.  Multiple articles can be written in this format, and the resulting
output can be fed to rnews (on another system, for example) to inject
those articles into \s-1INN\s0.  This option cannot be used with \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR,
\&\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-i\fR, or \fB\-R\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Store the article given on standard input using the normal storage rules
for articles as configured in \fIstorage.conf\fR\|(5).  Print the new token for
the message to standard output if it is stored successfully.  If this
option is given, no other options except possibly \fB\-q\fR should be given.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
If all operations were successful, \fBsm\fR exits with status 0.  If an
operation on any of the provided tokens fails, \fBsm\fR will exit with status
1, even if the operations on other tokens were successful.  In other
words, if twenty tokens are fed to \f(CW\*(C`sm \-r\*(C'\fR on stdin, 19 articles were
successfully removed, but the sixth article couldn't be found, \fBsm\fR will
still exit with status 1.
.PP
This means that if you need to be sure whether a particular operation
succeeded, you should run sm on one token at a time.
