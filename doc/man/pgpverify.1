.IX Title "PGPVERIFY 1"
.TH PGPVERIFY 1 "2004-01-11" "INN 2.4.1" "InterNetNews Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
pgpverify \- Cryptographically verify Usenet control messages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBpgpverify\fR [\fB\-test\fR] < \fImessage\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBpgpverify\fR program reads (on standard input) a Usenet control
message that has been cryptographically signed using the \fBsigncontrol\fR
program (or some other program that produces a compatible format).
\&\fBpgpverify\fR then uses a \s-1PGP\s0 implementation to determine who signed the
control message.  If the control message has a valid signature,
\&\fBpgpverify\fR prints (to stdout) the user \s-1ID\s0 of the key that signed the
message.  Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero exit status.
.PP
If \fBpgpverify\fR is installed as part of \s-1INN\s0, it uses \s-1INN\s0's configuration
to determine what signature verification program to use, how to log
errors, what temporary directory to use, and what keyring to use.
Otherwise, all of those parameters can be set by editing the beginning of
this script.
.PP
By default, when running as part of \s-1INN\s0, \fBpgpverify\fR expects the \s-1PGP\s0 key
ring to be found in \fIpathetc\fR/pgp (as either \fIpubring.pgp\fR or
\&\fIpubring.gpg\fR depending on whether \s-1PGP\s0 or GnuPG is used to verify
signatures).  If that directory doesn't exist, it will fall back on using
the default key ring, which is in a \fI.pgp\fR or \fI.gnupg\fR subdirectory of
the running user's home directory.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The \fB\-test\fR flag causes \fBpgpverify\fR to print out the input that it is
passing to \s-1PGP\s0 (which is a reconstructed version of the input that
supposedly created the control message) as well as the output from \s-1PGP\s0's
analysis of the message.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
\&\fBpgpverify\fR may exit with the following statuses:
.IP "0\&" 5
.IX Item "0"
The control message had a good \s-1PGP\s0 signature.
.IP "1" 5
.IX Item "1"
The control message had no \s-1PGP\s0 signature.
.IP "2" 5
.IX Item "2"
The control message had an unknown \s-1PGP\s0 signature.
.IP "3" 5
.IX Item "3"
The control message had a bad \s-1PGP\s0 signature.
.IP "255" 5
.IX Item "255"
A problem occurred not directly related to \s-1PGP\s0 analysis of signature.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
\&\fBpgpverify\fR does not modify or otherwise alter the environment before
invoking the \fBpgp\fR or \fBgpgv\fR program.  It is the responsibility of the
person who installs \fBpgpverify\fR to ensure that when \fBpgp\fR or \fBgpgv\fR
runs, it has the ability to locate and read a \s-1PGP\s0 key file that contains
the \s-1PGP\s0 public keys for the appropriate Usenet hierarchy administrators.
\&\fBpgpverify\fR can be pointed to an appropriate key ring by editing
variables at the beginning of this script.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Historically, Usenet news server administrators have configured their news
servers to automatically honor Usenet control messages based on the
originator of the control messages and the hierarchies for which the
control messages applied.  For example, in the past, David Lawrence always
issued control messages for the \*(L"Big 8\*(R" hierarchies (comp, humanities,
misc, news, rec, sci, soc, talk).  Usenet news administrators would
configure their news server software to automatically honor newgroup and
rmgroup control messages that originated from David Lawrence and applied
to any of the Big 8 hierarchies.
.PP
Unfortunately, Usenet news articles (including control messages) are
notoriously easy to forge.  Soon, malicious users realized they could
create or remove (at least temporarily) any Big 8 newsgroup they wanted by
simply forging an appropriate control message in David Lawrence's name.
As Usenet became more widely used, forgeries became more common.
.PP
The \fBpgpverify\fR program was designed to allow Usenet news administrators
to configure their servers to cryptographically verify control messages
before automatically acting on them.  Under the pgpverify system, a Usenet
hierarchy maintainer creates a \s-1PGP\s0 public/private key pair and
disseminates the public key.  Whenever the hierarchy maintainer issues a
control message, he uses the \fBsigncontrol\fR program to sign the control
message with the \s-1PGP\s0 private key.  Usenet news administrators configure
their news servers to run the \fBpgpverify\fR program on the appropriate
control messages, and take action based on the \s-1PGP\s0 key User \s-1ID\s0 that signed
the control message, not the name and address that appear in the control
message's From or Sender headers.
.PP
Thus, appropriate use of the \fBsigncontrol\fR and \fBpgpverify\fR programs
essentially eliminates the possibility of malicious users forging Usenet
control messages that sites will act upon, as such users would have to
obtain the \s-1PGP\s0 private key in order to forge a control message that would
pass the cryptographic verification step.  If the hierarchy administrators
properly protect their \s-1PGP\s0 private keys, the only way a malicious user
could forge a validly-signed control message would be by breaking the
public key encryption algorithm, which (at least at this time) is believed
to be prohibitively difficult for \s-1PGP\s0 keys of a sufficient bit length.
