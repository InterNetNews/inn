=head1 NAME

nnrpd - NNTP server for reader clients

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nnrpd> [B<-DfnoSt>] [B<-4> I<address>] [B<-6> I<address>] [B<-b> I<address>]
[B<-c> I<configfile>] [B<-i> I<initial>] [B<-I> I<instance>]
[B<-p> I<port>] [B<-P> I<prefork>] [B<-r> I<reason>] [B<-s> I<padding>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<nnrpd> is an NNTP server for newsreaders.  It accepts commands on its
standard input and responds on its standard output.  It is normally
invoked by innd(8) with those descriptors attached to a remote client
connection.  B<nnrpd> also supports running as a standalone daemon.

Unlike innd(8), B<nnrpd> supports all NNTP commands for user-oriented
reading and posting.  B<nnrpd> uses the F<readers.conf> file to control
who is authorized to access the Usenet database.

On exit, B<nnrpd> will report usage statistics through syslog(3).

B<nnrpd> only reads config files (both F<readers.conf> and F<inn.conf>)
when it is spawned.  You can therefore never change the behavior of a
client that's already connected.  If B<nnrpd> is run from B<innd> (the
default) or from inetd(8), xinetd(8), or some equivalent, a new B<nnrpd>
process is spawned for every connection and therefore any changes to
configuration files will be immediately effective for all new
connections.  If you are instead running B<nnrpd> with the B<-D> option,
any configuration changes won't take effect until B<nnrpd> is restarted.

The F<inn.conf> setting I<nnrpdflags> can be used to pass any of the
options below to instances of B<nnrpd> that are spawned directly from
B<innd>.  Many options only make sense when B<-D> is used, so these
options should not be used with I<nnrpdflags>.  See also the discussion
of I<nnrpdflags> in inn.conf(5).

When I<nnrpdloadlimit> in F<inn.conf> is not C<0>, it will also reject
connections if the load average is greater than that value (typically
C<16>).  B<nnrpd> can also prevent high-volume posters from abusing
your resources.  See the discussion of exponential backoff in inn.conf(5).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-4> I<address>

The B<-4> parameter instructs B<nnrpd> to bind to the specified IPv4
address when started as a standalone daemon using the B<-D> flag.  This
has to be a valid IPv4 address belonging to an interface of the local
host.  It can also be C<0.0.0.0>, saying to bind to all addresses (this
is the default).

=item B<-6> I<address>

The B<-6> parameter instructs B<nnrpd> to bind to the specified IPv6
address when started as a standalone daemon using the B<-D> flag.  This
has to be a valid IPv6 address belonging to an interface of the local
host.  It can also be C<::0>, saying to bind to all IPv6 addresses.

By default, B<nnrpd> in daemon mode listens to both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses.  With this option, it will listen only to the specified
IPv6 addresses.  On some systems however, a value of C<::0> will cause
it to listen to all IPv4 addresses as well.

=item B<-b> I<address>

Similar to the B<-4> flag.  B<-b> is kept for backwards compatibility.

=item B<-c> I<configfile>

By default, B<nnrpd> reads the F<readers.conf> to determine how to
authenticate connections.  The B<-c> flag specifies an alternate file
for this purpose.  If the file name isn't fully qualified, it is taken
to be relative to I<pathetc> in F<inn.conf>.  (This is useful to have
several instances of B<nnrpd> running on different ports or IP
addresses with different settings.)

=item B<-D>

If specified, this parameter causes B<nnrpd> to operate as a daemon.  That
is, it detaches itself and runs in the background, forking a process for
every connection.  By default, B<nnrpd> listens on the NNTP port (119), so
either innd(8) has to be started on another port or the B<-p> parameter
used.  Note that with this parameter, B<nnrpd> continues running
until killed.  This means that it reads F<inn.conf> once on startup and
never again until restarted.  B<nnrpd> should therefore be restarted if
F<inn.conf> is changed.

When started in daemon mode, B<nnrpd> will write its PID into a file in
the I<pathrun> directory.  The file will be named F<nnrpd-%d.pid>, where
C<%d> is replaced with the port that B<nnrpd> is configured to listen on
(119 unless the B<-p> option is given).

=item B<-f>

If specified, B<nnrpd> does not detach itself and runs in the
foreground when started as a standalone daemon using the B<-D> flag.

=item B<-i> I<initial>

Specify an initial command to B<nnrpd>. When used, I<initial> is taken
as if it were the first command received by B<nnrpd>.

=item B<-I> I<instance>

If specified, I<instance> is used as an additional static portion
within message-IDs generated by B<nnrpd>; typically this option would
be used where a cluster of machines exist with the same virtual
hostname and must be disambiguated during posts.

=item B<-n>

The B<-n> flag turns off resolution of IP addresses to names.  If you
only use IP-based restrictions in F<readers.conf> and can handle IP
addresses in your logs, using this flag may result in some additional
speed.

=item B<-o>

The B<-o> flag causes all articles to be spooled instead of sending
them to innd(8).  B<rnews> with the B<-U> flag should be invoked from
cron on a regular basis to take care of these articles.  This flag is
useful if innd(8) is accepting articles and B<nnrpd> is started
standalone or using inetd(8).

=item B<-p> I<port>

The B<-p> parameter instructs B<nnrpd> to listen on I<port> when
started as a standalone daemon using the B<-D> flag.

=item B<-P> I<prefork>

The B<-P> parameter instructs B<nnrpd> to prefork I<prefork> children
awaiting connections when started as a standalone daemon using the
B<-D> flag.

=item B<-r> I<reason>

If the B<-r> flag is used, then B<nnrpd> will reject the incoming
connection giving I<reason> as the text.  This flag is used by innd(8)
when it is paused or throttled.

=item B<-s> I<padding>

As each command is received, B<nnrpd> tries to change its C<argv>
array so that ps(1) will print out the command being executed.  To get
a full display, the B<-s> flag may be used with a long string as its
argument, which will be overwritten when the program changes its
title.

=item B<-S>

If specified, B<nnrpd> will start a negotiation for a TLS session as
soon as connected.  To use this flag, B<--with-openssl> must have been
specified at configure time.  For more information on running B<nnrpd>
with TLS support, see L<TLS SUPPORT>.

=item B<-t>

If the B<-t> flag is used, then all client commands and initial
responses will be traced by reporting them in syslog.  This flag is set
by innd(8) under the control of the ctlinnd(8) C<trace> command, and
is toggled upon receipt of a SIGHUP; see signal(2).

=head1 TLS SUPPORT

If INN is built with B<--with-openssl>, B<nnrpd> will support news reading
over TLS (also known as SSL).  For clients that use the STARTTLS command,
no special configuration is needed beyond creating a TLS/SSL certificate
for the server.  You should do this in exactly the same way that you would
generate a certificate for a web server.

If you're happy with a self-signed certificate (which will generate
warnings with some news reader clients), you can create and install one in
the default path by running C<make cert> after C<make install> when
installing INN, or by running the following commands:

    umask 077
    openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out <pathetc>/cert.pem \
        -days 366 -keyout <pathetc>/key.pem
    chown news:news <pathetc>/cert.pem
    chmod 640 <pathetc>/cert.pem
    chown news:news <pathetc>/key.pem
    chmod 600 <pathetc>/key.pem

Replace the paths with something appropriate to your INN installation.
This will create a self-signed certificate that will expire in a year.
The B<openssl> program will ask you a variety of questions about your
organization.  Enter the fully qualified domain name of the server as the
name the certificate is for.

You then have to set these F<inn.conf> parameters with the right paths:

    tlscapath:      <pathetc>
    tlscertfile:    <pathetc>/cert.pem
    tlskeyfile:     <pathetc>/key.pem

In case you have a certificate authority root certificate, you can also
set I<tlscafile> to its path.

Most news clients currently do not use the STARTTLS command, however, and
instead expect to connect to a separate port (563) and start a TLS
negotiation immediately.  B<innd> does not, however, know how to listen
for connections to that port and then spawn B<nnrpd> the way that it does
for regular reader connections.  You will therefore need to arrange for
B<nnrpd> to listen on that port through some other means.  This can be
done with the B<-D> flag along with C<-p 563> and put into your init scripts:

    su news -c '<pathbin>/nnrpd -D -p 563 -S'

but the easiest way is probably to add a line like:

    nntps stream tcp nowait news <pathbin>/nnrpd nnrpd -S

to F</etc/inetd.conf> or the equivalent on your system and let B<inetd>
run B<nnrpd>.  (Change the path to B<nnrpd> to match your installation.)
You may need to replace C<nntps> with C<563> if C<nntps> isn't
defined in F</etc/services> on your system.

=head1 PROTOCOL DIFFERENCES

B<nnrpd> implements the NNTP commands defined in S<RFC 3977> (NNTP),
S<RFC 4642> (TLS/NNTP) and S<RFC 4643> (NNTP authentication) with the
following differences:

=over 4

=item 1.

Besides the keywords defined in S<RFC 3977> (ACTIVE, ACTIVE.TIMES,
DISTRIB.PATS, HEADERS, NEWSGROUPS and OVERVIEW.FMT), the LIST command
may be followed by the optional keywords DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD
and SUBSCRIPTIONS to get a list of valid distributions, the moderators list,
the message of the day information for readers, or a list of the
automatic group subscriptions.

=item 2.

The XGTITLE [I<wildmat>] command is provided.  This extension is used by
ANU-News and documented in S<RFC 2980>.  It returns a C<282> reply code,
followed by a one-line description of all newsgroups that match the
pattern.  The default is the current group.

Note that LIST NEWSGROUPS should be used instead of XGTITLE.

=item 3.

The XHDR I<header> [I<message-ID>|I<range>] command is implemented.  It is
based on the reference Unix implementation.  See S<RFC 2980>.

=item 4.

The XOVER [I<range>] command is provided. It returns a C<224> reply code,
followed by the overview data for the specified range; the default is to
return the data for the current article.

=item 5.

A new command, XPAT I<header> I<message-ID>|I<range> I<pattern>
[I<pattern> ...], is provided.  The first argument is the case-insensitive
name of the header to be searched.  The second argument is either an article
range or a single message-ID, as specified in S<RFC 2980>.  The third
argument is a uwildmat(3)-style pattern; if there are additional arguments,
they are joined together separated by a single space to form the complete
pattern.  This command is similar to the XHDR command.  It returns a C<221>
response code, followed by the text response of all article numbers that
match the pattern.
