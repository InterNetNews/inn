=head1 IN A NUTSHELL

These programs permit keeping the list of newsgroups carried by your news
server synchronized with an external source.

For instance, you can decide to carry the same newsgroups as another news
server or as listed in a file from an external FTP or web site, and then
synchronize with the chosen source on a daily basis by running B<actsyncd> in
a cron job.

If you only want a subset of newsgroups from that source, it can be
parameterized in the F<actsync.ign> configuration file in the I<pathetc>
directory.

INN comes with a default configuration for fetching the list of
newsgroups from C<downloads.isc.org> (also known as C<ftp.isc.org>).
You can read about the policies used for maintaining that F<active> file
at L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.  Just make
sure F<actsync.cfg> (the configuration file) and F<actsync.ign> (the
synchronization rules) suit your needs, and run:

    actsyncd <pathetc>/actsync.cfg

You'll find more detailed examples of use below in this manual page.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<actsync> permits one to synchronize, compare, or merge two F<active>
files.  With this utility one may add, change, or remove newsgroups on the
local news server to make it similar to the list of the newsgroups found on
another system or file.  The synchronization need not be exact.  Local
differences in newsgroup lists may be maintained and preserved.  Certain
newsgroup errors may be detected and optionally corrected.

There are several reasons to run B<actsync> (or B<actsyncd>) on a periodic
basis.  Among the reasons are:

=over 2

=item *

A control message to add, change or remove a newsgroup may fail to reach
your site.

=item *

Your F<control.ctl> file may be out of date or incomplete.

=item *

News articles for a new newsgroup may arrive ahead (sometimes days ahead)
of the control message.

=item *

Control messages may be forged, thus bypassing the restrictions
found in F<control.ctl> unless you set up PGP authentication (and even
then, not all hierarchies use PGP authentication).

=item *

Your F<active> file may have been trashed.

=back

If either I<host> argument begins with C<.> or C</>, it is assumed to be the
name of a file containing information in the active(5) format.  Newsgroup
information from a file may be treated as if it was obtained from a host.
In this manual page, the I<host> arguments on the command line are called
hosts, even though they may be file names.

If a host argument does not begin with C<.> or C</>, it is assumed to be a
hostname or Internet address.  In this case, B<actsync> will attempt to
use the NNTP protocol to obtain a copy of the specified system's
F<active> file.  If the host argument contains C<:>, the right side will be
considered the port to connect to on the remote system.  If no port number
is specified, B<actsync> will connect to port C<119>.

Regardless how the F<active> file information is obtained, the actions of
B<actsync> remain the same.

The first host specified is taken to be the local host, the one where any
changes would be made.  The second host specified is the remote host that
is being synchronized with.  If only one host is specified, it is assumed
to be the remote host to synchronize with, and the local host is assumed
to be the default local NNTP server as specified by the NNTPSERVER
environment variable or by the I<server> value found in F<inn.conf>.

If either host is specified as C<->, the default server will be used for
that host, determined as described above.

The newsgroup synchronization, by default, involves all newsgroups found
on both hosts.  One may also synchronize a subset of newsgroups by
directing B<actsync> to ignore certain newsgroups from both systems.  Only
newsgroups with valid names will be synchronized.  To be valid, a
newsgroup name must consist only of alphanumeric characters, C<.>, C<+>,
C<->, and C<_>.  One may not have two C<.> characters in a row.  The first
character must be alphanumeric, as must any character following C<.>.
The name may not end in a C<.> character.

The B<actsyncd> daemon provides a convenient interface to configure and
run B<actsync>.  If a host is not initially reachable, the daemon will
retry up to 9 additional times, waiting 6 minutes before each retry.
This daemon runs in the foreground, sending output to standard output
and standard error.  B<actsyncd> runs the getlist(1) utility to obtain
a copy of a remote system's F<active> file via its NNTP server, or
runs an FTP or web client program (B<wget> or B<ncftpget> if installed
and found at configure time, or the simpleftp(1) program shipped with
INN) to fetch a list of newsgroups from an external archive (such as
L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active>; see more about this
below).  It then uses mod-active(8) to update the F<active> file if there are
commands for B<ctlinnd> in its output.

The configuration filename for the daemon is given as a command line argument,
usually F<actsync.cfg> in I<pathetc>.  This file can contain the following
options:

    host=<host>
    path=<path-to-active>
    protocol=<protocol>
    flags=<actsync-options>
    ignore_file=<ignore-file>

The C<host=>, C<flags=>, and C<ignore_file=> lines are mandatory.
Each keyword must start at the beginning of the line, and there may be no
whitespace before the C<=> character.  Blank lines are ignored, as are comment
lines that start with C<#>.  Any other lines may produce undefined results.

The <host> setting refers to the second (remote) I<host> parameter
to B<actsync>.  If <path-to-active> is not provided, <protocol> is
considered to be C<nntp>, and <host> is accessed as a remote NNTP server.
If <path-to-active> is provided, <host> is accessed as an FTP or web server
depending on the value of <protocol> (C<ftp>, C<http> or C<https>, defaulting
to C<ftp> when unset), retrieving the F<active> file at the <path-to-active>
absolute path.  If the filename ends in C<.bz2>, C<.gz> or C<.Z>, it will
be automatically uncompressed after retrieval.  <actsync-options> contains
any other flags that you wish to pass to B<actsync>. <ignore-file> names the
ignore file used by B<actsync> (the B<-i> option).

Note that one should not include B<-i> or B<-o> options in the C<flags=> line;
they are automatically taken care of by B<actsyncd>.

One may produce a trial B<actsyncd> run without changing anything on
the server by supplying the I<debug-level> argument:

    actsyncd <pathetc>/actsync.cfg 2

The I<debug-level> causes B<actsyncd> to run B<actsync> with a B<-v>
I<debug-level> flag (overriding any B<-v> flag on the C<flags=> line),
not make any changes to the F<active> file, write a new F<active> file to
standard output, and write debug messages to standard error.  Note that using
I<debug-level> is only supported when synchronizing with another news server,
not with FTP or HTTP(S).

If the I<debug-format> argument is also given to B<actsyncd>, the data
written to standard output will be in C<-o I<debug-format>> instead of in
C<-o a1> format.

INN comes with default values of C<downloads.isc.org> for <host>
and C</pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.gz> for <path-to-active>:

    host=downloads.isc.org
    path=/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.gz
    protocol=https
    flags=-v 0 -p 80
    ignore_file=actsync.ign

You can read about the policies used for maintaining that F<active> file at
L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.  Consider synchronizing
from this file on a daily basis by using a cron job.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<actsync> takes the following options.

In all of the following options, the I<hostid> parameter takes one of the
following values:

    0    neither server
    1    local default server
    2    remote server
    12   both servers
    21   both servers

In other words, C<1> refers to the local host (the first I<host> argument
on the B<actsync> command line) and C<2> refers to the remote host (the
second I<host> argument, or the only one if only one is given).

=over 4

=item B<-A>

B<actsync> tries to authenticate using the username and password information
in passwd.nntp(5) before issuing the LIST command.

=item B<-b> I<hostid>

This flag causes B<actsync> to ignore for synchronization purposes
newsgroups with C<bork.bork.bork>-style names (newsgroups whose last 3
components are identical).  For example, the following newsgroups have
bork-style names:

    alt.helms.dork.dork.dork
    alt.auto.accident.sue.sue.sue
    alt.election.vote.vote.vote

The default is C<-b 0>; no newsgroups are ignored because of bork-style
names.

=item B<-d> I<hostid>

This flag causes B<actsync> to ignore newsgroups that have all numeric
path components.  For example, the following newsgroups have numeric path
components:

    alt.prime.chongo.23209
    391581.times.2.to_the.216193.power.-1
    99.bottles.of.treacle.on.the.wall
    linfield.class.envio_bio.101.d

The newsgroups directory of a newsgroup with a all numeric component
could conflict with an article from another group if stored using the
tradspool storage method; see storage.conf(5).  For example, the directory
for the first newsgroup listed above is the same path as article number
23209 from the newsgroup:

    alt.prime.chongo

The default is C<-d 0>; all numeric newsgroups from both hosts will be
processed.

=item B<-g> I<max>

Ignore any newsgroup with more than I<max> levels.  For example, C<-g 6>
would ignore:

    alt.feinstien.votes.to.trash.freedom.of.speech
    alt.senator.exon.enemy.of.the.internet
    alt.crypto.export.laws.dumb.dumb.dumb

but would not ignore:

    alt.feinstien.acts.like.a.republican
    alt.exon.amendment
    alt.crypto.export.laws

If I<max> is C<0>, then the max level feature is disabled.

By default, the max level feature is disabled.

=item B<-i> I<ignore-file>

The I<ignore-file>, usually F<actsync.ign> in I<pathetc>, allows one to
have a fine degree of control over which newsgroups are ignored.  It
contains a set of rules that specifies which newsgroups will be checked
and which will be ignored.

By default, these rules apply to both hosts.  This can be modified by
using the B<-I> flag.

Blank lines and text after a C<#> are considered comments and are ignored.

Rule lines consist of tokens separated by whitespace.  Rule lines may be
one of two forms:

    c <newsgroup> [<type> ...]
    i <newsgroup> [<type> ...]

If the rule begins with a C<c>, the rule requests certain newsgroups to be
checked.  If the rule begins with an C<i>, the rule requests certain
newsgroups to be ignored.  The <newsgroup> field may be a specific
newsgroup, or a I<uwildmat> pattern.

If one or more <type>s are specified, then the rule applies to the
newsgroup only if it is of the specified type.  Types refer to the 4th field
of the F<active> file; that is, a type may be one of:

    y
    n
    m
    j
    x
    =group.name

Unlike F<active> files, the C<group.name> in an alias type may be a newsgroup
name or a I<uwildmat> pattern.  Also, C<=> is equivalent to C<=*>.

On each rule line, no pattern type may be repeated.  For example, one
may not have more than one type that begins with C<=>, per line.  However,
one may achieve an effect equivalent to using multiple C<=> types by using
multiple rule lines affecting the same newsgroup.

By default, all newsgroups are candidates to be checked.  If no I<ignore-file>
is specified, or if the ignore file contains no rule lines, all newsgroups
will be checked.  If an ignore file is used, each newsgroup in turn is
checked against the ignore file.  If multiple lines match a given newsgroup,
the last line in the ignore file is used.

For example, consider the following ignore file lines:

    i *.general
    c *.general m
    i nsa.general

The newsgroups ba.general and mod.general would be synchronized if
moderated and ignored if not moderated.  The newsgroup nsa.general would
be ignored regardless of moderation status.  All newsgroups not matching
*.general would be synchronized by default.

=item B<-I> I<hostid>

This flag restricts which hosts are affected by the ignore file.  This
flag may be useful in conjunction with the B<-m> flag.  For example:

    actsync -i actsync.ign -I 2 -m host1 host2

will keep all newsgroups currently on I<host1>.  It will also only
compare I<host1> groups with non-ignored newsgroups from I<host2>.

The default is C<-I 12>; newsgroups from both hosts are ignored per the
file specified with B<-i>.

=item B<-k>

By default, any newsgroup on the local host that has an invalid name will
be considered for removal.  This causes B<actsync> simply ignore such
newsgroups.  This flag, used in combination with B<-m>, will prevent any
newsgroup from being scheduled for removal.

=item B<-l> I<hostid>

This flag causes problem newsgroups of type C<=> to be considered as
errors.  Newsgroups of type C<=> are newsgroups F<active> entries that have a
fourth field that begins with C<=>; i.e., newsgroups that are aliased to
other newsgroups.  A problem newsgroup is one for which one of the
following is true:

=over 2

=item *

Aliased to itself.

=item *

In an alias chain that loops around to itself.

=item *

In an alias chain longer than 16 groups.

=item *

Aliased to a non-existent newsgroup.

=item *

Aliased to a newsgroup that has an error of some kind.

=back

However, a newsgroup that is equivalent to an ignored newsgroup is not a
problem.

The default is C<-l 12>: problem newsgroups from both hosts are marked
as errors.

=item B<-m>

Merge newsgroups instead of sync.  By default, if a newsgroup exists on
the local host but not the remote, it will be scheduled to be removed.
This flag disables this process, permitting newsgroups unique to the local
host to be kept.

=item B<-n> I<name>

Depending on B<-o>, the ctlinnd(8) command may be used to create
newsgroups as necessary.  When this is done, the default creator name used
is C<actsync>.  This flag changes the creator name to I<name>.

=item B<-o> I<format>

Determine the output or action format of this utility.  I<format> may be
one of:

=over 4

=item a

Output in active(5) format.

=item a1

Output in active(5) format and output non-error ignored groups from the
local host.

=item ak

Output in active(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active
fields) values from the remote host for any newsgroup being created.

=item aK

Output in active(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active
fields) values from the remote host for all newsgroups found on that host.

=item a1k

Output in active(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active
fields) values from the remote host for any newsgroup being created and
output non-error ignored groups from the local host.

=item a1K

Output in active(5) format, but use the high and low (2nd and 3rd active
fields) values from the remote host for all newsgroups found on that host
and output non-error ignored groups from the local host.

=item ak1

Same as C<a1k>.

=item aK1

Same as C<a1K>.

=item c

Output as commands to B<ctlinnd>.

=item x

No output.  Instead, directly run B<ctlinnd> commands.

=item xi

No output.  Instead, directly run B<ctlinnd> commands in an interactive
mode.

=back

The C<a>, C<a1>, C<ak>, C<aK>, C<a1k>, C<a1K>, C<ak1>, and C<aK1> style
formats allow one to format new F<active> file instead of producing B<ctlinnd>
commands.  They use high and low values of C<0000000000> and C<0000000001>
respectively for newsgroups that are created unless otherwise specified.
The C<ak> and C<aK> variants change the high and low values (2nd and
3rd F<active> fields).  In the case of C<ak>, newsgroups created take their
high and low values from the remote host.  In the case of C<aK>, all
newsgroups found on the remote host take their high and low values from
it.

The C<c> format produces B<ctlinnd> commands.  No actions are taken
because B<actsync> simply prints B<ctlinnd> commands on standard output.
This output format is useful to let you see how the local host will be
affected by the sync (or merge) with the remote host.

The sync (or merge) may be accomplished directly by use of the C<x> or
C<xi> format.  With this format, B<actsync> uses the execl(2) system call
to directly execute B<ctlinnd> commands.  The output of such exec calls
may be seen if the verbosity level is at least C<2>.

The B<actsync> utility will pause for 4 seconds before each command is
executed if C<-o x> is selected.  See the B<-z> flag below for
discussion of this delay and how to customize it.

The C<xi> format interactively prompts on standard output and reads
directives on standard input.  One may pick and choose changes using this
format.

Care should be taken when producing active(5) formatted output.  One
should check to be sure that B<actsync> exited with a zero status prior to
using such output.  Also one should realize that such output will not
contain lines ignored due to B<-i> even if C<-p 100> is used.

By default, C<-o c> is assumed.

=item B<-p> I<min-unchanged>

By default, the B<actsync> utility has safeguards against performing
massive changes.  If fewer than I<min-unchanged> percent of the non-ignored
lines from the local host remain unchanged, no actions (output, execution,
etc.) are performed and B<actsync> exits with a non-zero exit status.
The I<min-unchanged> value may be a floating point value such as C<66.667>.

A change is a local newsgroup line that was removed, added, changed,
or found to be in error.  Changing the 2nd or 3rd F<active> fields via
C<-o ak> or C<-o aK> are not considered changes by B<-p>.

To force B<actsync> to accept any amount of change, use the C<-p 0>
option.  To force B<actsync> to reject any changes, use the C<-p 100>
option.

Care should be taken when producing active(5) formatted output.  One
should check to be sure that B<actsync> exited with a zero status prior to
using such output.  Also one should realize that such output will not
contain lines ignored due to B<-i> even if C<-p 100> is used.

By default, 96% of the lines not ignored in the first I<host> argument
on the B<actsync> command line must be unchanged.  That is, by default,
C<-p 96> is assumed.

=item B<-q> I<hostid>

By default, all newsgroup errors are reported on standard error.  This
flag quiets errors from the specified I<hostid>.

=item B<-s> I<size>

If I<size> is greater than 0, then ignore newsgroups with names longer
than I<size> and ignore newsgroups aliased (by following C<=> chains) to
names longer than I<size>.  Length checking is performed on both the local
and remote hosts.

By default, I<size> is C<0> and thus no length checking is performed.

=item B<-t> I<hostid>

Ignore improper newsgroups consisting of only a top component from the
specified I<hostid>.  The following newsgroups are considered proper
newsgroups despite top only names and therefore are exempt from this flag:

    control
    general
    junk
    test
    to

For example, the following newsgroup names are improper because they only
contain a top level component:

    dole_for_pres
    dos
    microsoft
    windows95

The default is C<-t 2>; that is, all improper top-level-only newsgroups
from the remote host are ignored.

=item B<-T>

This flag causes newsgroups on the remote host in new hierarchies to be
ignored.  Normally a newsgroup which only exists on the remote host,
chongo.was.here for example, is created on the local host.  However, if
this flag is given and the local host does not have any other newsgroups
in the same hierarchy (chongo.* in this case), the newsgroup in question
will be ignored and will not be created on the local host.

=item B<-v> I<verbosity>

By default, B<actsync> is not verbose.  This flag controls the verbosity
level as follows:

=over 2

=item 0Z<>

No debug or status reports (default).

=item 1Z<>

Print summary, but only if work was needed or done.

=item 2Z<>

Print actions, exec output, and summary, but only if work was needed or
done.

=item 3Z<>

Print actions, exec output, and summary.

=item 4Z<>

Full debug output.

=back

=item B<-w> I<seconds>

If C<-o x> or C<-o xi> is selected, B<ctlinnd> will wait I<seconds> seconds
before timing out.  The default value is C<-w 30>.

=item B<-z> I<seconds>

If C<-o x> is selected, B<actsync> will pause for I<seconds> seconds
before each command is executed.  This helps prevent B<innd> from being
busied-out if a large number of B<ctlinnd> commands are needed.  One can
entirely disable this sleeping by using C<-z 0>.

By default, B<actsync> will pause for C<4> seconds before each command is
executed if C<-o x> is selected.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Determine the difference (but don't change anything) between your newsgroup
set and the one of another news server:

    actsync news.server.com

Same as above, with full debug and progress reports:

    actsync -v 4 news.server.com

Force a site to have the same newsgroups as some other site:

    actsync -o x master

This may be useful to sync a slave site to its master, or to sync internal
site to a gateway.

Compare your site with news.server.com, disregarding local groups and
certain local differences with it.  Produce a report if any differences were
encountered:

    actsync -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.server.com

where F<actsync.ign> contains:

    # Don't compare to.* groups as they will differ.
    #
    i       to.*

    # These are our local groups that nobody else
    # (should) carry.  So ignore them for the sake
    # of the compare.
    #
    i       nsa.*

    # These groups are local favorites, so keep them
    # even if news.server.com does not carry them.
    #
    i       ca.dump.bob.dorman
    i       ca.keep.bob.dorman
    i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die
    i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.love.love.love
    i       alt.sounds.*    =alt.binaries.sounds.*

To interactively sync against news.server.com, using the same ignore file:

    actsync -o xi -v 2 -i actsync.ign news.server.com

Based on newsgroups that you decided to keep, one could make changes to
the F<actsync.ign> file:

    # Don't compare to.* groups as they will differ.
    #
    i       to.*

    # These are our local groups that nobody else
    # (should) carry.  So ignore them for the sake
    # of the compare.
    #
    i       nsa.*

    # These groups are local favorites, so keep them
    # even if news.server.com does not carry them.
    #
    i       ca.dump.bob.dorman
    i       alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die
    i       alt.sounds.*    =alt.binaries.sounds.*

    # Don't sync test groups, except for ones that are
    # moderated or that are under the gnu hierarchy.
    #
    i       *.test
    c       *.test m        # check moderated test groups
    c       gnu.*.test
    c       gnu.test        # just in case it ever exists

Automatic processing may be set up by using the following F<actsync.cfg>
file:

    # Host to sync off of (host2).
    host=news.server.com

    # Location of the ignore file.
    ignore_file=<pathetc in inn.conf>/actsync.ign

    # actsync(8) flags
    #
    # Automatic execs, report if something was done,
    # otherwise don't say anything, don't report
    # news.server.com active file problems, just ignore
    # the affected entries.
    flags=-o x -v 2 -q 2

and then by running B<actsyncd> with the path to the config file:

    actsyncd <pathetc>/actsync.cfg

The command

    actsyncd <pathetc>/actsync.cfg 4 >cmd.log 2>dbg.log

will operate in debug mode, not change the F<active> file, write B<ctlinnd>
style commands to F<cmd.log>, and write debug statements to F<dbg.log>.
(Note that using I<debug-level> is only supported when synchronizing with
another news server, not with FTP or HTTP(S).)

To check only the major hierarchies against news.server.com, use the following
F<actsync.ign> file:

    # By default, ignore everything.
    #
    i       *

    # Check the major groups.
    #
    c       alt.*
    c       comp.*
    c       gnu.*
    c       humanities.*
    c       misc.*
    c       news.*
    c       rec.*
    c       sci.*
    c       soc.*
    c       talk.*

and the command:

    actsync -i actsync.ign news.server.com

To determine the differences between your old F<active> and your current
default server:

    actsync <pathetc>/active.old -

To report but not fix any newsgroup problems with the current F<active> file:

    actsync - -

To detect any newsgroup errors on your local server, and to remove any
*.bork.bork.bork-style silly newsgroup names:

    actsync -b 2 - -

The F<active> file produced by:

    actsync <flags> -o x erehwon.honey.edu

is effectively the same as the F<active> file produced by:

    cd <pathdb>
    ctlinnd pause 'running actsync'
    rm -f active.new
    actsync <flags> -o a1 erehwon.honey.edu > active.new
    rm -f active.old
    ln active active.old
    mv active.new active
    ctlinnd reload active 'running actsync'
    ctlinnd go 'running actsync'

It should be noted that the final method above, pausing the server and
simply replacing the F<active> file, may be faster if you are making lots
of changes.

=head1 FILES

=over 4

The C program itself used to synchronize, compare, or merge two F<active>
files.

=item I<pathbin>/actsyncd

The Shell daemon which provides a convenient interface to configure and
run B<actsync>.

=item I<pathetc>/actsync.cfg

=head1 CAUTION

Careless use of this tool may result in the unintended addition, change,
or removal of newsgroups.  You should avoid using the C<x> output format
until you are sure it will do what you want.

=head1 BUGS

If a newsgroup appears multiple times, B<actsync> will treat all copies as
errors.  However, if the group is marked for removal, only one rmgroup
will be issued.
