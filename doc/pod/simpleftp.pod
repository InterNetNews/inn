=head1 NAME

simpleftp - Rudimentary FTP client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<simpleftp> I<url> [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<simpleftp> is a Perl script that provides basic support for fetching
files with FTP in a batch oriented fashion.  It takes one or more FTP URLs
on the command line.  The file(s) will be retrieved from the remote server
and placed in the current directory with the same basename as on the remote;
e.g., L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.gz> is stored as
F<active.gz> in the current directory.

The script properly understands usernames, passwords and ports specified
as follows:

    ftp://user:password@host:port/path/file

=head1 BUGS

B<simpleftp> is an extremely poor substitute for more complete programs
like the freely available B<wget> or B<ncftp> utilities.  It was written
only to provide elementary support in INN for non-interactive fetching of
the files in L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/> or
L<https://downloads.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/> without requiring
administrators to install yet another package.  Its shortcomings as a
general purpose program are too numerous to mention, but one that stands
out is that downloaded files by B<simpleftp> override existing files
with the same name in the local directory.
