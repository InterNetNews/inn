=head1 NAME

ovdb_monitor - Database maintenance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use B<ovdb_init> to start B<ovdb_monitor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When started (normally by B<ovdb_init> that is invoked by B<rc.news>),
B<ovdb_monitor> forks three processes that perform routine database
maintenance tasks.  These are transaction checkpointing (every 30 seconds),
deadlock detection (every 30 seconds), and transaction log removal (every 45
seconds).

The process ID of the parent is written to F<ovdb_monitor.pid> in the
I<pathrun> directory.  This PID is used by other INN commands to verify
that B<ovdb_monitor> is running.

To shut down B<ovdb_monitor>, send a TERM signal to the process ID
in F<ovdb_monitor.pid>.  The parent process will shut down the three
children and wait for their exit before exiting itself.  Note that when
running the C<rc.news stop> command to stop the news system, B<rc.news>
automatically takes care of stopping B<ovdb_monitor>.
