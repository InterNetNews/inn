=head1 Upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4

Currently, there are no incompatible differences between INN 2.3 and
2.4, unless you use nnrpd's Perl authentication hooks.  A simple C<make
update> should be sufficient (you probably need to add 

	hismethod:              hisv6

to inn.conf).  If you are upgrading from a version prior to INN 2.3, see
L<"Upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3">.

If you use Perl authentication for nnrpd (if nnrpdperlauth in inn.conf
is true), however, there have been major changes.  See L<"Changes to
Perl Authentication Support for nnrpd"> in F<doc/hook-perl> for details.

=item *

All accesses to the history file for all parts of INN now go through a
generic API like the storage and overview subsystems do.  This will
eventually allow new history implementations to be dropped in without
affecting the rest of INN, and will significantly improve the
encapsulation of the history subsystem.  See the libinnhist(3) man page
for the details of the interface.

=item *

Variables can now be used in the newsfeeds file to make it easier to
specify a lot of similar feeds or feed patterns.  See the newsfeeds(5) man
page for more details.

=item *

Local connections to INN support a new special mode, MODE CANCEL, that
allows efficient batch cancellation of messages.  This is intended to be
the preferred interface for external spam and abuse filters like NoCeM.

=item *

Thanks to code contributed by CMU, innfeed can now feed an IMAP server as
well as other NNTP servers.  See the man page for innfeed for more
information.

=item *

An authenticator that checks a username and password against a remote
Samba server is now included.

=item *

The interface between external authenticators and nnrpd is now wrapped in
a library, which should make it easier to write additional authenticators.

=item *

INN now checks to ensure that the configured temporary directory is not
world-writeable since INN doesn't currently create all temporary files in
a manner that's safe against symlink attacks.

=item *

Two configure options have changed names:  --with-tmp-path is now
--with-tmp-dir and --with-largefiles is now --enable-largefiles to improve
consistency and better match the autoconf option guidelines.

=item *

Preliminary IPv6 support has been added, it is off by default.  Build with
--enable-ipv6 to try it.  Hopefully, nobody will notice any problems with
the default configuration, although some changes have been made to data
structures even when IPv6 is disabled.  Further information is available
in F<doc/IPv6-info>.

=item *

All of the applicable bug fixes from the INN 2.3 STABLE series are also
included in INN 2.4.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3

There may be additional things to watch out for not listed here; if you
run across any, please let inn-bugs@isc.org know about them.

Simply doing a make update is not sufficient to upgrade; the history and
overview information will also have to be regenerated, since the formats
of both files have changed between 2.2 and 2.3.  Regardless of whether you
were using the storage API or traditional spool under 2.2, you'll need to
rebuild your overview and history files.

If you want to allow readers, or if you want to expire based on newsgroup
name, you need to tell INN to generate overview data and pick an overview
method by setting ovmethod in inn.conf.  See INSTALL and inn.conf(5) for
more details.

The code that generates the dbz index files has been split into a seperate
program, makedbz.  makehistory still generates the base history file and
the overview information, but some of its options have been changed.  To
rebuild the history and overview files, use:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -T/usr/local/news/tmp -l 600000

(Change the /usr/local/news/tmp path to some directory that has plenty of
temporary space, and leave off -O if you're running a transit-only server
and don't intend to expire based on group name, and therefore don't need
overview.)  Or use:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -F

(This is suitable for the "buffindexed" overview backend.)  Both will
generate a new history file as history.n and rebuild overview at the same
time.  If you want to preseve a record of expired message IDs in the
history file, run:

    awk 'NF==2 { print; }' < history >> history.n

to append them to the newly created history file.  Look over the new
history file and make sure it looks right, then generate the new index
files and move them into place:

    makedbz -s `wc -l <history.n` -f history.n
    mv history.n history
    mv history.n.dir history.dir
    mv history.n.hash history.hash
    mv history.n.index history.index

(Rather than .hash and .index files, you may have a .pag file if you're
using tagged hash.)

For a reader machine, F<nnrp.access> has been replaced by F<readers.conf>.
There currently isn't a program to convert between the old format and the
new format (if you'd like to contribute one, it would be welcomed
gratefully).  The new file is unfortunately considerably more complex to
support its new capabilities; please carefully read the example
F<readers.conf> provided and the man page when setting up your initial
configuration.  The provided commented-out examples cover the most common
installation (IP-based authentication for all machines on the local
network).

INN makes extensive use of mmap for the new overview mechanisms, so at the
present time NFS-mounting the spool and overview from one central server
on multiple reader machines probably isn't feasible in this version.  mmap
tends to interact poorly with NFS (at the least, NFS clients won't see
updates to the mapped files in situations where they should).  (The
preferred way to fix this would, rather than backing out the use of mmap
or making it optional, to add support for Diablo-style header feeds and
pull-on-demand of articles from a master server.)

The flags for overchan have changed, plus you probably don't want to run
overchan at all any more.  Letting innd write overview data itself results
in somewhat slower performance, but is more reliable and has a better
failure mode under high loads.  Writing overview data directly is the
default, so in a normal upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3 you'll want to comment out
or remove your overchan entry in F<newsfeeds> and set useoverchan to false
in F<inn.conf>.

crosspost is no longer installed, and no longer works (even with
traditional spool).  If you have an entry for crosspost in F<newsfeeds>,
remove it.

If you're importing a traditional spool from a pre-storage API INN server,
it's strongly recommended that you use NNTP to feed the articles to your
new server rather than trying to build overview and history directly from
the old spool.  It's more reliable and ensures that everything gets put
into the right place.  The easiest way to do this is to generate, on your
old server, a list of all of your existing article files and then feed
that list to innxmit.

If you are using a version of Cleanfeed that still has a line in it like:

    $lines = $hdr{'__BODY__'} =~ tr/\n/\n/;

you will need to change this line to:

    $lines = $hdr{'__LINES__'};

to work with INN 2.3 or later.  This is due to an internal optimization of
the interface to embedded filters that's new in INN 2.3.

=head1 Changes from 2.2 to 2.3

=over 2

=item *

New F<readers.conf> file (replaces F<nnrp.access>) which allows more
flexible specification of access restrictions.  Included in the sample
implementations is a RADIUS-based authenticator.

=item *

Unified overview has been replaced with an overview API, and there are now
three separate overview implementations to choose from.  One (tradindexed)
is very like traditional overview but uses an additional index file.  The
second (buffindexed) uses large buffers rather than separate files for
each group and can handle a higher incoming article rate while still being
fast for readers.  The third (ovdb) uses Berkeley DB to store overview
information (so you need to have Berkeley DB installed to use it).  The
ovmethod key in F<inn.conf> chooses the overview method to use.

Note that ovdb has not been as widely tested as the other overview
mechanisms and should be considered experimental.

=item *

All article storage and retrieval is now done via the storage API.
Traditional spool is now available as a storage type under the storage
API.  (Note that the current traditional spool implementation causes
nightly expire to be extremely slow for a large number of articles, so
it's not recommended that you use the tradspool storage method for the
majority of a large spool.)

=item *

The timecaf storage method has been added, similar to timehash but storing
multiple articles in a single file.  See F<INSTALL> for details on it.

=item *

INN now supports embedded Python filters as well as Perl and TCL filters,
and supports Python authentication hooks.

=item *

There is preliminary support for news reading over SSL, using OpenSSL.

=item *

Users can no longer post articles containing Approved: headers to
moderated groups by default; they must be specifically given that
permission with the access: parameter in F<readers.conf>.  See the man
page for more details.

=item *

To simplify anti-abuse filtering, and to be more compliant with news
standards and proposed standards, INN now treats as control messages only
articles containing a Control header.  A Subject line beginning with
C<cmsg > is no longer sufficient for a message to be considered a control
message, and the Also-Control header is no longer supported.

=item *

inews is not installed setgid news and rnews is not installed setuid root
by default any more.  If you need the old permissions, you have to give a
flag to configure.  See F<INSTALL> for more details.

=item *

The INN build system no longer uses subst.  (This will be transparent to
most users; it's an improvement and modernization of how INN is
configured.)

=item *

The build and installation system has been substantially overhauled.  make
update now updates scripts as well as binaries and documentation, there is
better support for parallel builds (with make -j), there is less needless
make recursion, and far more of the system-dependent configuration is
handled directly by autoconf.  libtool build support (including shared
library support) should be better than previous releases.

=item *

All of the applicable bug fixes from the INN 2.2 STABLE series are also
included in INN 2.3.

=back

=head1 Changes from 2.1 to 2.2

=over 2

=item *

New storage.conf file (replaces storage.ctl).

=item *

New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control messages (controlchan)
that serializes them and prevents server overload from control message
storms.

=item *

Support for actsyncd to fetch active file with ftp; configured by default
to use <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.Z> if you run actsyncd.
Be sure to read the manual page for actsync to configure an actsync.ign
file for your site, and test simpleftp if you do not configure with wget
or ncftp.  Also see <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.

=item *

Some options to configure are now moved to inn.conf (merge-to-groups and
pgp-verify).

=item *

inndf, a portable version of df(1) is supplied.

=item *

New cnfsstat program to show stats of cnfs buffers.

=item *

news2mail and mailpost programs for gatewaying news to mail and mail to
news are supplied.

=item *

pullnews program for doing a sucking feed is provided (not meant for large
feeds).

=item *

The innshellvars.csh.in script is obsolete (and lives in the obsolete
directory, for now).
