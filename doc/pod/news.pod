The use of the I<domain> parameter is now disambiguated:

=over 2

=item *

The newsmaster's e-mail address mentioned in the help message returned
by B<nnrpd> now uses I<fromhost> (set in F<inn.conf> or overridden in
F<readers.conf>) as the default domain name instead of I<domain>.

=back

=item *

The LIST OVERVIEW.FMT command now uses the preferred format to advertise
C<:bytes> and C<:lines> metadata to news clients using CAPABILITIES.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.7.3 (not yet released)

=over 2

=item *

B<actsyncd> now supports fetching a remote F<active> file from a web site,
using the HTTP or HTTPS protocols.  Two new keywords, I<path> and I<protocol>,
permit parameterizing that in the F<actsync.cfg> configuration file.  See the
actsync(8) manual page and the updated F<actsync.cfg> sample file for more
details.

If you are currently using B<actsyncd> to synchronize your F<active> file
with the one of an FTP server, please check that FTP access is still working
and the remote F<active> file is up to date.  You are otherwise encouraged
to update your F<actsync.cfg> configuration file to use an HTTPS access.
Just adding C<protocol=https> may be enough.  The rationale behind that is
the fact that FTP servers are considered less secure nowadays; FTP access
to C<ftp.isc.org> is doomed to be shut down one day in favour of HTTPS.
The updated B<actsyncd> and B<simpleftp> programs shipped with INN go along
with the upcoming change.

=item *

B<simpleftp>, only used by B<actsyncd>, now supports fetching files from
web servers, using the HTTP(S) protocol.  It now also correctly parses a
port number following a hostname (separated by a colon), and establishes FTP
sessions in passive mode as this mode works better behind firewalls and NAT
configurations.

=item *

Added bzip2 support to B<actsyncd> to uncompress downloaded F<active> files.

=item *

Fixed syntax warnings in the default F<filter_innd.py> Python hook so that
B<innd> no longer logs errors with S<Python 3.12> and greater.  Thanks to
Roberto Corrado for the patch.

=item *

The check for a fully qualified domain name for the local host at startup
still produces a warning in the logs but is no longer fatal.  The installation
of INN was otherwise failing under some circumstances like when creating a
Docker image.  Additionally, the INN_HOSTNAME environment variable, if set and
fully qualified, is now taken by INN as the hostname.

=item *

Several improvements have been made to readership statistics reported by
B<innreport>: IPv6 addresses are now correctly recognized and reported
as unresolved instead of unknown, statistics by domain are at a better
granularity, totals are correctly computed, and only the top 100 entries are
displayed by default instead of a possibly very long exhaustive list.

=item *

Fixed the computation of idle time in the B<nnrpd> timers gathered by
B<innreport>, and the display of non-printable characters in the section about
unrecognized NNRP commands.  The wording and the case of the section titles
are also more homogenized.

=item *

Improved Perl code readability and quality by enforcing the most interesting
and useful C<Perl::Critic> policies.  A new C<make code-check> command has
been added to run the checks against the source code.

=item *

Spelling fixes in documentation.  Thanks to Christian Clauss for the
run of B<codespell>.

=item *

Move the manual pages of B<delayer>, B<shlock> and B<sm> to section 8 (system
administration commands) instead of section 1 (user commands).

=item *

Update from GNU Libtool 2.4.7 to 2.5.4.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.7.2 (2024-06-22)

=over 2

=item *

Up-to-date F<control.ctl> and F<nocem.ctl> files are provided with this
release.  You may want to manually update your configuration with the new
information recorded about hierarchies and NoCeM issuers, and make sure the
relevant PGP keys are installed on your system.

=item *

Added a new I<ovflushcount> parameter in F<inn.conf>, defaulting to C<50>,
to parameterize the number of articles received between flushing their
overview data to disk, when using the buffindexed overview storage method.
(In previous releases, that number was ten times the value of I<icdsynccount>,
but a dedicated parameter is better.)

=item *

Added the C<INN::ovsqlite_client> Perl module to access an ovsqlite overview
database through B<ovsqlite-server> from a Perl script.  This module provides
search, add, remove and expire functions for information stored in an ovsqlite
database (newsgroups and overview data associated to articles in these
newsgroups).  Many thanks to Bo Lindbergh for it, as well as for two samples
in the F<contrib> directory (B<ovsqlite-dump> and B<ovsqlite-undump>) showing
how to use the module.

=item *

Added two new options in F<storage.conf>, contributed by Christoph Biedl:

=over 2

=item *

a I<filtered> option to store articles which have been rejected by a
Perl or Python filter for B<innd> into a separate storage class, when
I<dontrejectfiltered> is set to true in F<inn.conf>;

=item *

a I<path> option to store articles by the contents of the Path header field,
notably to isolate the storage of spammy sites from other sites.

=back

=item *

The B<delayer> program, which previously was in the F<contrib> directory, is
now installed by default.  It notably permits generating a delayed feed, for
instance to give cancel control articles and NoCeM messages time to arrive,
and therefore actually cancel articles before they are locally stored.  Thanks
to Christoph Biedl for the documentation, testing, and addition of several
useful flags to B<delayer>.

=item *

B<innreport> now supports high-precision timestamps like
C<2023-07-29T04:15:01.889064+02:00> that syslog can be parameterized to use;
daily Usenet reports otherwise indicated all these logs as unknown entries
because a format like C<Jul 29 04:15:01> was expected.

=item *

B<innreport> now alphabetically sorts lines which have the same rank instead
of displaying them in random order.

=item *

B<scanspool> now detects empty files in a tradspool news spool and directories
with an all-digit component (which may conflict with a possible file with
the same name), correctly parses continuation lines in header fields, and can
automatically remove articles reported to have a problem (when run with the
new B<-r> flag).

=item *

Added several new options to better parameterize B<perl-nocem>.  The location
of its configuration file, the keyring to use, and the full B<gpg> and
B<gpgv> commands to run can now be modified by flags passed to the program.
Unprocessed NoCeM notices will also show up in daily Usenet reports generated
by B<innreport>.  Log verbosity can be controlled, cancelled articles can
be backed up into files, and B<perl-nocem> can write logs to a separate
F<perl-nocem.log> file.  Local rules to fine-tune within a NoCeM notice which
articles get cancelled can also be applied.  See its manual page for more
information about the use of these options.

=item *

B<perl-nocem> now correctly parses the identifiers of NoCeM issuers with
special characters like C<+> in the configuration file.

=item *

Fixed a hang when posting articles if COMPRESS DEFLATE is active but TLS
is not.  Thanks to Enrik Berkhan for the patch for B<nnrpd>.

=item *

B<innd> no longer dies when C<ctlinnd trace> is run on an invalid channel.

=item *

INN now properly handles header field names starting with a leading dot:
B<innd> accurately computes the C<:bytes> metadata item of articles with such
header field names, and B<nnrpd> correctly preserves the leading initial dot
at injection time and rightly parses such header field names in HDR, XHDR and
XPAT commands.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now rejects articles with invalid dot-stuffing (that is to say when
a dot at the beginning of a line is not doubled) as it is a violation of the
NNTP protocol.  (B<innd> still goes on accepting and propagating such articles
as they have already been injected and propagated.)

=item *

Fixed the computation of the Bytes header field by B<pullnews> (in header-only
mode with the B<-B> flag).

=item *

Fixed the generation of B<rnews> batches by B<pullnews> (when using the B<-r>
flag) which had not the expected native LF line termination.

=item *

Fixed B<inndf> on 32-bit architectures with large file support (previously,
B<inndf> could not count more than 2^32 bytes or inodes on these
architectures).

=item *

Fixed an issue preventing articles from expiring when using the ovsqlite
method, in a very rare case.  When an article had more than 100,000 bytes
of overview data (for instance with a Subject header field of that length),
overview expiration was no longer done for newsgroups carrying this article.
Such articles, which most certainly are spams anyway, are no longer added to
the ovsqlite database.  Thanks for Jesse Rehmer for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a database lock issue when running B<ovsqlite-util> on a running server
with the I<transtimelimit> parameter in F<ovsqlite.conf> set to a higher value
than the default busy timeout of 30 seconds of B<ovsqlite-util>.  Thanks to
Jesse Rehmer for the bug report and Bo Lindbergh for the fix.

=item *

Fixed a foreign key issue preventing B<ovsqlite-util> from fixing problems
found when running with the B<-F> flag.

=item *

B<innd> no longer malfunctions nor throttles when the maximum number of file
descriptors supported by the system is reached.  If needing to use more file
descriptors than the default system limit, a new C<LARGE_FD_SETSIZE> option
can be set at build time.  See the documentation for I<rlimitnofile> in
F<inn.conf> for more information.  Thanks to Jesse Rehmer for the bug report.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.7.1 (2023-04-16)

=over 2

=item *

Added a new I<groupexactcount> parameter in F<readers.conf> to force B<nnrpd>
to report the exact number of still existing articles in newsgroups instead of
an estimated count.  When the estimated number of articles is strictly below
I<groupexactcount> (set to C<5> by default), B<nnrpd> now recounts them and
reports the actual value (articles that have been cancelled or overwritten in
self-expiring CNFS buffers may otherwise still be counted in the estimate).
News clients will then be directly aware of empty newsgroups; they would
otherwise have tried to retrieve possible articles, to finally not show
anything to the user.

=item *

Programs sending mails now include, when appropriate, an Auto-Submitted
header field in the message headers (either set to C<auto-generated> or
C<auto-replied>, following the recommendation in S<RFC 3834>).  Thanks to
Harald Dunkel for this suggestion which will for instance help to avoid
unnecessary vacation replies.

=item *

Added a new B<-a> option to B<innmail> to specify additional header fields to
add in the headers of messages.  This is notably used to internally support
the addition of the Auto-Submitted header field in outgoing mails.

=item *

Added new B<ovsqlite-util> program to perform some basic consistency checks
and dump operations on an overview database using the ovsqlite method.
More checks and features will be added in future releases.  You'll need the
C<DBI> Perl module with the C<DBD::SQLite> driver installed on your system to
use this program.

=item *

Added TLS support in B<pullnews> for connections to upstream servers
configured in F<pullnews.marks>, and to the downstream server in the existing
B<-s> flag.  A port can now also be specified for connections to upstream
servers (it was already possible for the downstream server only).

=item *

Added a new B<-L> option to B<pullnews> to specify the largest wanted article
size in bytes.  Articles whose size exceeds that value will no longer be
downloaded by B<pullnews>.

=item *

B<pullnews> now detects a socket timeout while downloading articles from
a remote peer.  The download gracefully stops, and another attempt can be
automatically made according to the setting given with the B<-t> flag.  Thanks
to Jesse Rehmer for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed the generation and the handling of storage tokens on wrapped CNFS
buffers, thanks to bug reports from Kamil Jonca:

=over 2

=item *

Duplicate entries were returned by B<makehistory> on fully wrapped cyclic
buffers (the first article of the cyclic buffer appeared twice in the output).

=item *

The first article of a fully wrapped cyclic buffer was removed too soon from
F<history> (B<expire> wrongly thought its storage token was no longer existing
after a wrap).

=item *

The first article of the previous cycle number of a cyclic buffer containing
articles from two different cycle numbers was wrongly considered by
B<makehistory> to belong to the current cycle number.

=back

=item *

B<innd> no longer dies when a F<newsfeeds> entry has an unexpected trailing
whitespace.

=item *

The size of duplicated articles was counted twice in totals, average article
sizes and graphs by B<innreport>, when parsing B<innd> checkpoints.  Thanks to
Hauke Lampe for the patch to count it only once.

=item *

Customizing the domain part of Message-IDs generated by B<nnrpd> and the
server name indicated in Injection-Info header fields is now easier: the
I<domain> parameter in the access blocks of F<readers.conf> can be directly
used (without needing to set I<virtualhost> as it was previously the case).

=item *

If the I<domain> parameter is set in F<inn.conf> or in a F<readers.conf>
access block, and has invalid characters, or if the fully qualified domain
name (FQDN) of the news server has invalid characters when I<domain> is unset,
a fatal error is now reported at startup.  It is a basic configuration error
which otherwise leads to the generation of invalid article Message-IDs.

=item *

Improved the speed of article searches with HDR, LAST, NEXT, and XPAT commands
when there is a (huge) gap in article numbers.  On newsgroups with several
millions of consecutive missing articles (which is a rare situation), these
commands could take several seconds to run.

=item *

Incoming articles in newsgroups that have exceeded the maximum number of
articles they can contain (2^31-1) are now correctly rejected.  INN was
otherwise happily accepting them but either numbers returned in NNTP responses
were not right, or some news clients choked when receiving unexpected large
article numbers.  (The current version of the NNTP protocol only allows
article numbers up to 2^31-1.)

=item *

Fixed the renumbering of reported low water marks for empty newsgroups in
F<active> after overview expiration, when using the ovsqlite method.  They
were set to 1 for empty newsgroups whereas they were not supposed to decrease.
(These reported low water marks regained their expected values during the next
overview expiration, provided that the newsgroup was no longer empty.)

=item *

The reported high water mark of empty newsgroups is now correctly set to
one less than the reported low water mark in overview data.  (Previously,
the reported low water mark was set to one more than the reported high water
mark.)

=item *

Fixed the output of the C<ctlinnd feedinfo ''> command that was returning
information only for the first site, and the output of the C<ctlinnd name
channel> command that was returning partial information for the requested
channel.

=item *

The build of external programs which include F<inn/storage.h> was failing
because of the unexpected inclusion of F<config.h> in one of the included
headers.  Also, a few Autoconf results were not correctly made available to
external programs.  This is now fixed.

=item *

Fixed the build on systems whose default shell does not completely meet the
Posix standard.  A few build scripts were run with the default shell instead
of the one found by Autoconf and afterwards used for INN.

=item *

Use standard daemon(3) C function, when available, to daemonize B<innd>,
B<nnrpd>, B<ovdb_server> and B<ovsqlite-server> instead of an INN-specific
function.

=back

=head1 Upgrading from 2.6 to 2.7

The following changes require your full attention because a manual
intervention may be needed:

=over 2

=item *

The I<require_ssl> parameter in F<readers.conf> has been renamed to
I<require_encryption> as it applies to any kind of encryption layers,
including TLS and SASL security layers.  Since B<innupgrade> only takes care
of the change in the file named F<readers.conf>, you will have to manually
rename that parameter in configuration files for B<nnrpd> with an alternate
name.

=item *

The F<innreport.conf> file in I<pathetc> has been split into a general
configuration file (F<innreport.conf> itself) and a display configuration
file (F<innreport-display.conf> in I<pathlib>).  If you made local changes
in sections other than the I<default> section in F<innreport.conf>, and
wish to keep them, then you need renaming the new F<innreport-display.conf>
file to another name in I<pathlib>, setting this local file name in the new
I<display_conf_file> option in F<innreport.conf>, and re-applying your local
changes to that local display configuration file.

As a matter of fact, the default display configuration file would otherwise
be overwritten each time INN is updated.  Bug fixes or enhancements are
made from time to time to the display configuration of B<innreport>, and
previously couldn't be automatically be merged in F<innreport.conf> on update.
This new separate configuration file to parameterize the display will now
permit an automatic update (if of course you use the default display
configuration file).

=item *

A new F<inn-secrets.conf> configuration file has been added in I<pathetc>.
The intent is that, from now on, new secrets used by INN are added to that
file, and that all secrets currently stored in several other configuration
files eventually move to that file.  Make sure it is properly created during
the upgrade, and not world-readable.  It currently only stores the secrets
used for the new Cancel-Lock functionality.

=item *

The B<-C> flag given to B<innd> to disable the execution of cancels has been
deprecated and is no longer taken into account (an error message will be
present in your logs if B<innd> is started with it).  Instead, a new parameter
has been added in F<inn.conf> to tune the types of cancels B<innd> should
process.  If I<docancels> is set to C<require-auth>, which is the default
if INN has Cancel-Lock support, only articles originally protected by the
Cancel-Lock authentication mechanism can be withdrawn by a valid authenticated
cancel article or a valid authenticated supersede request.  Withdrawals of
articles not originally protected by Cancel-Lock will not be executed.
See inn.conf(5) for more details about the different values of the new
I<docancels> parameter, and make sure to parameterize it according to your
needs.

=item *

The I<refusecybercancels> and I<verifycancels> parameters have been removed
from F<inn.conf>.  The first was performing an inefficient and inexact check
(that should be done, if wanted, in the special C<ME> entry in F<newsfeeds>,
or even better, ask your peers not to feed you articles with C<cyberspam>
in the Path header field body); the second check performed on the newsgroups
present in cancel articles was not useful in B<innd> (this check is relevant
to posting agents).

The related lines in F<inn.conf> will be commented by B<innupgrade> during the
upgrade.

=item *

The XBATCH command is no longer enabled by default in B<innd>.  You'll have
to explicitly enable that capability by setting the new I<xbatch> parameter to
true in F<incoming.conf> for the peers sending you such compressed batches.

=item *

The I<nolist> and I<noresendid> parameters in F<incoming.conf> have been
respectively renamed to I<list> and I<resendid> (and the meaning of their
related boolean values is now the opposite).  Besides, the unused I<comment>
and I<email> parameters in F<incoming.conf> have been removed.  B<innupgrade>
will take care of the changes (inverting the boolean values, and commenting
the lines with removed parameters).

=item *

B<filechan> is no longer shipped with INN; it was just a simple version of
B<buffchan>.  All calls to C<filechan> will be changed to C<buffchan -u>
(for its unbuffered mode) in F<newsfeeds> by B<innupgrade>.  If you have
local scripts running B<filechan>, you will have to manually take care of
the change.

=item *

B<send-nntp> is no longer shipped with INN.  If you have local scripts
running it, you will have to manually adjust them to use B<nntpsend> which
basically does the same thing, better.  Or, even greater, use B<innfeed>
if that is possible.

=item *

Wrappers around old Perl and Python authentication and access hooks,
pre-dating S<INN 2.4.0> and identifiable by the I<nnrpperlauth> and
I<nnrppythonauth> parameters in F<inn.conf>, are no longer shipped as samples
in INN releases.  If not already done, you should either replace old hooks
with new modern hooks or use the possibilities that F<readers.conf> and
regular authenticator and resolver programs offer.

=item *

The F<libauth.h> header file and the B<libstorage> library have been renamed
to F<libinnauth.h> and B<libinnstorage> to homogenize their name with existing
B<libinnhist> library.  External programs building or linking against them
need a manual change.

=back

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.6>, see also
L<Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6>.

=head1 Changes in 2.7.0 (2022-07-10)

=over 2

=item *

Upgrading to a major release is a good time to ensure that your configuration
files, that are usually kept untouched during normal updates, are
up-to-date: notably F<control.ctl> (with your local changes in a separate
F<control.ctl.local> file), new better default values in F<inn.conf>
and F<innfeed.conf>, improvements in F<innreport.conf> (along with
F<innreport-display.conf>) and F<innreport.css>, fixes in F<innwatch.ctl>,
updated F<moderators> and F<nocem.ctl> files.

You may also want to check that the PGP keys used to verify the signature
of control articles and NoCeM notices are still up-to-date and working.
The keys of a few hierarchies and NoCeM issuers have recently changed.

=item *

Bo Lindbergh has implemented a new overview storage method based
on SQLite, known for its long-term stability and compatibility.
Robust and faster at reading ranges of overview data, but somewhat
slower at writing, this new SQLite-based method is a perfect choice to
store overview data.

To select it as your overview method, set the I<ovmethod> parameter in
F<inn.conf> to C<ovsqlite>.  Details about ovsqlite, the F<ovsqlite.conf>
configuration file and how to switch to that new modern overview storage
method can be found in the ovsqlite(5) and makehistory(8) man pages.

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented Cancel-Lock support in B<innd> and B<nnrpd>,
based on S<RFC 8315> and libcanlock.  A new F<inn-secrets.conf> configuration
file has been added in I<pathetc> wherein you can set the secrets to use for
Cancel-Lock.  See the inn-secrets.conf(5) man page for more details.

A new B<-F> flag is recognized by B<innconfval> to indicate the type of file
to parse (by default, C<inn.conf>); just run C<innconfval -F inn-secrets.conf>
to get the values of that new configuration file.  Another new flag, B<-f>,
permits specifying another file name to parse than the standard one.

The I<addcanlockuser> parameter has been added in F<readers.conf> to
deactivate the generation of user-specific hashes when several different
posters have the same identity in an access group.  This parameter also
permits setting whether the hash, when generated, is based on the username or
the (static) IP of the connection.

=item *

Added a new tool, B<gencancel>, to help the news administrator generate
authenticated cancel control messages, with the expected admin Cancel-Key
hashes.  See the gencancel(1) man page for more details.

=item *

A new I<docancels> parameter has been added in F<inn.conf> to define which
types of cancels B<innd> should process.  The B<-C> flag given to B<innd>
is deprecated in favour of that new parameter (you'll see in your logs the
message C<innd -C flag has been deprecated and has no effect; use docancels in
inn.conf> in case you're passing that flag to B<innd>).

=item *

Andreas Kempe has implemented blacklistd support in B<nnrpd>.  This daemon,
available notably in FreeBSD and NetBSD, can be used to prevent brute force
attacks by blocking attackers after a number of failed login attempts.
When B<nnrpd> is run with the new B<-B> flag, and INN has been configured
with the new B<--with-blacklist> option, it will report login attempts to the
blacklistd daemon for potential blocking.

=item *

Building INN with TLS support using LibreSSL is now supported (only
OpenSSL was previously officially supported and tested).

=item *

Fixed the parsing of I<hosts> and I<localaddress> parameters in
F<readers.conf>; exclusion patterns (beginning with C<!>) have not been
working since S<INN 2.5.0>.

=item *

Improved the robustness of B<innxmit> when receiving C<500> or C<501>
response codes from peers, indicating they do not understand the NNTP
command or (wrongly) think there is a syntax error.  Richard Kettlewell
added a proper handling of these responses, making B<innxmit> dropping
the refused article instead of keeping sending it over and over (and
thus receiving each time the same error in response codes).

=item *

B<innreport> now collects statistics from B<innxbatch> and generates a
section for them in its reports.

=item *

The F<innreport.conf> file in I<pathetc>, previously containing almost 2500
lines, has been split into a general configuration file (F<innreport.conf>
itself, still in I<pathetc>, with about 60 lines) and a display configuration
file (F<innreport-display.conf>, a new separate file in I<pathlib>).
The name of this display configuration file can be parameterized in the new
I<display_conf_file> option in F<innreport.conf>.

=item *

The B<-m> flag given to B<mailpost> now sets a List-ID header field instead of
a Mailing-List header field.

=item *

B<rc.news>, used to start and stop INN daemons, now checks whether it is
run as the news user.  It will exit if not the case, to ensure not to
tamper with the ownership of files INN manipulates.

=item *

B<filechan> has been removed; it was just a simple version of B<buffchan>,
which should now be used.

=item *

B<send-nntp> has been removed; it was just a simple version of B<nntpsend>,
which should now be used (or, even better, B<innfeed>).

=item *

The I<refusecybercancels> and I<verifycancels> parameters have been removed
from F<inn.conf>.  Besides, B<inews> no longer checks if the From or Sender
header fields of a cancel or supersede request match the ones of the original
article being withdrawn.  All of these were either inefficient or inexact
checks.

=item *

The I<xbatch> parameter has been added in F<incoming.conf> to enable the
XBATCH command in B<innd> for specific remote peers.  The default is to
disable the capability.

=item *

The I<nolist> and I<noresendid> parameters in F<incoming.conf> have been
respectively renamed to I<list> and I<resendid> (and the meaning of their
related boolean values is now the opposite).  Besides, the unused I<comment>
and I<email> parameters in F<incoming.conf> have been removed.

=item *

B<inews> no longer adds a Sender header field nor overwrites an existing
one in articles it processes if the new B<-P> flag is used.  The Path header
field, if unset, no longer systematically contains the path identity of the
local news server (you may want to add it manually with the B<-x> flag, if
needed).  Finally, B<inews> also no longer adds the obsolescent Lines header
field.

=item *

A new B<-E> flag can now be given to B<inews> to silently discard empty
articles, instead of bailing out with an error.  Another new B<-m> flag
permits setting the Message-ID instead of letting B<inews> generate one.
And a third new flag, B<-Y>, forces B<inews> to authenticate to the remote
news server even if not asked to.

=item *

B<signcontrol> has been removed as it embeds per-site configuration
which is overwritten each time INN is updated to a newer version,
and it is unlikely you ever need it.  Nonetheless, if you need to
issue PGP-signed control messages, you can still download it from
L<https://ftp.isc.org/pub/pgpcontrol/>.

=item *

Support in B<controlchan> for obsolete I<sendsys>, I<senduuname> and
I<version> control messages has been removed.  These control messages,
long been deprecated, should no longer be sent nor honoured nowadays.
Besides, the C<doifarg> keyword in F<control.ctl> is no longer recognized
(it was only used for these three kinds of control messages).

=item *

The I<require_ssl> parameter in F<readers.conf> has been renamed to
I<require_encryption>, which is a better name as it applies to any kind of
encryption layers, including TLS and SASL security layers.

=item *

Fixed the use of a deprecated API in S<Kerberos V5>.  INN now requires
version 1.6.1 or higher of S<MIT Kerberos v5> to build.

=item *

The F<libauth.h> header file and the B<libstorage> library have been renamed
to F<libinnauth.h> and B<libinnstorage> to homogenize their name with existing
B<libinnhist> library.

=head1 Changes in 2.6.5 (2022-02-18)

=over 2

=item *

A new step in INN development has been achieved with the migration of the
INN project to GitHub.  We now make use of the features GitHub provides:
issue tracker, pull requests, continuous integration, a user-friendly
interface to browse the code, etc.  Our Subversion repository has
therefore been migrated to Git, and our Trac tickets to the GitHub
issue tracker.

=item *

An up-to-date F<nocem.ctl> file is provided with this release.
You should manually update your F<nocem.ctl> file with the new
information recorded about NoCeM issuers, and make sure the right PGP
keys are present on your system.

=item *

Up-to-date F<control.ctl> and F<moderators> files are provided with this
release.  You should manually update them (notably for the fido7.* hierarchy).

=item *

Added a stricter validation of article numbers given in NNTP commands
so that numbers superior to 2^31 are correctly considered invalid.
Thanks to Richard Kettlewell for the patch.

=item *

Added a check in B<rc.news> for the existence of the I<pathrun>
directory.  INN won't start until this directory is writable.
Previously, it bailed out quickly after starting, without clear logs
about why it failed.

=item *

Fixed parallel builds using C<make -j>.  Thanks to Richard Kettlewell
for the path.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now properly gathers timer statistics when a compression layer
is active.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now properly discards data received from a news client after
a timeout when a TLS layer is active.  It previously tried to read
incoming data before closing the socket, leading to decoding errors
from an underlying compression or SASL layer.

=item *

B<innfeed> and B<ovdb_stat> now generate status reports in valid HTML syntax.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the buffindexed overview that prevented it from working
on several systems, amongst them FreeBSD.  Unsupported, and useless,
permission bits were given to semaphores.

=item *

Fixed the detection of library paths at configure time: multilib
directories (F<lib32> or F<lib64>) are now also used if they exist,
even if the system does not use multilib.  It will notably fix the
detection of the S<OpenSSL 3.0.0> library.

=item *

The I<tlscertfile> parameter in F<inn.conf> now permits the use of
a complete certificate chain, instead of necessarily having to use
I<tlscafile> for additional certificates.

=item *

Added support for the new S<OpenSSL 3.0.0> API, which deprecated a
few functions.

=item *

The F<inn.conf> default value for I<tlsprotocols> no longer contains
TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1, which have been deprecated by S<RFC 8996>.

=item *

A new F<inn.conf> parameter has been added to tune the length of the
queue of pending connections to B<innd>, B<nnrpd> and the C<ovdb>
overview storage method: the I<maxlisten> parameter now permits
configuring their listen backlog, whose previously hard-coded values
were C<128> for B<nnrpd> and C<25> for the others, which was not high
enough for some uses.  The default value is now C<128> for all of them,
and configurable in F<inn.conf>.  Thanks to Kevin Bowling for the patch.

=item *

The name of seven man pages for routines built in libinn(3) are now prefixed
with F<libinn_> so as not to consume namespace and conflict with other
packages (notably, the list(3) and uwildmat(3) man pages are now named
libinn_list(3) and libinn_uwildmat(3)).

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements, notably a revised
installation checklist and a section summarizing the most used configuration
at the beginning of a few complex man pages.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.4 (2021-01-21)

=over 2

=item *

Added support for systemd notifications and socket activation.  Use of more
features provided by systemd, including more notifications, will come
in future releases.  Thanks to Marco d'Itri for this first systemd
integration into INN.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now adapts the length of the DH parameter used during a DHE
key exchange so as to comply with the security level S<OpenSSL 1.1.0>
or later expects.  Thanks to Michael Baeuerle for the bug report.

=item *

B<cnfsstat> now also returns information about retired CNFS buffers:
buffers mentioned in F<cycbuff.conf> as a cycbuff but not declared in a
metacycbuff.

=item *

Switch default B<innreport> behaviour to the common practice of
externalizing CSS into a separate file.  Its name can be configured with
the I<html_css_url> parameter in F<innreport.conf>.  If this parameter is
unset, the default F<innreport.css> file name will be used and
B<innreport> will generate this CSS file for you.  Previously generated
reports are kept untouched, though, and will still contain inline CSS if
you had not already set the I<html_css_url> parameter in previous INN
versions.  Thanks to Richard Kettlewell for the patch.

=item *

B<sm> can now read and store any number of articles given in wire format
on its standard input when both B<-s> and B<-R> are used.  Only native
format was previously possible.  Thanks to Bo Lindbergh for the patch.

=item *

Added new B<-a> flag to B<rnews> to disallow, if needed, the use
of additional unpackers from the F<rnews.libexec> sub-directory of
I<pathbin> (as set in F<inn.conf>); only C<rnews> and C<cunbatch>
will then be recognized as valid batch commands.

=item *

Added new B<-b> flag to B<rnews> to save rejected articles in the F<bad>
sub-directory of I<pathincoming> (as set in F<inn.conf>).  Otherwise,
B<rnews> just logs and discards any articles that are rejected or cannot
be parsed for some reason.

=item *

Added new B<-d> flag to B<rnews> to log via syslog the Message-ID and the
Path header body of each article rejected as a duplicate.

=item *

Added new B<--enable-hardening-flags> configure-time option,
enabled by default, to use hardening build flags like C<-fPIE> and
C<-fstack-protector-strong>.  This option can easily be disabled if the
compiler or the platform does not support them well.  More hardening
build flags will eventually be added in future releases.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.3 (2019-02-07)

=over 2

=item *

Fixed the selection of the elliptic curve to use with S<OpenSSL 1.1.0>
or later; NIST P-256 was enforced instead of using the most secure curve.

=item *

A new F<inn.conf> parameter has been added to fine-tune the cipher suites
to use with S<TLS 1.3>: the I<tlsciphers13> now permits configuring
them.  A separate cipher suite configuration parameter is needed for
S<TLS 1.3> because S<TLS 1.3> cipher suites are not compatible with
S<TLS 1.2>, and vice-versa.  In order to avoid issues where legacy
S<TLS 1.2> cipher suite configuration configured in the I<tlsciphers>
parameter would inadvertently disable all S<TLS 1.3> cipher suites,
the F<inn.conf> configuration has been separated out.

=item *

Fixed a regression since S<INN 2.6.1> that prevented articles with
internationalized header fields (that is to say encoded in UTF-8)
from being posted.

=item *

Support for S<Python 3> has been added to INN.  Embedded Python filtering
and authentication hooks for B<innd> and B<nnrpd> can now use S<version
3.3.0> or later of the Python interpreter.  In the 2.x series, S<version
2.3.0> or later is still supported.

When configuring INN with the B<--with-python> flag, the C<PYTHON>
environment variable, when set, is used to select the interpreter
to embed.  Otherwise, it is searched in standard paths.

In case you change the Python interpreter to embed, make sure that
the Python scripts you use are written in the expected syntax for that
version of the Python interpreter.  Notably, buffer objects have been
replaced with memoryview objects in S<Python 3>, and UTF-8 encoding
now really matters for string literals (S<Python 3> uses bytes and
Unicode objects).

INN documentation and samples of Python hooks have been updated to
provide more examples.

=item *

When a Python or Perl filter hook rejects an article, B<innd> now mentions
the reason in response to CHECK and TAKETHIS commands.  Previously,
the reason was given only for the IHAVE command.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now properly logs the hostname of clients whose connection
failed owing to an issue during the negotiation of a TLS session or
high load average.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.2 (2018-03-18)

=over 2

=item *

A new I<syntaxchecks> parameter has been added in F<inn.conf>.
It permits controlling the level of checks performed by B<innd> and
B<nnrpd>.  Up to now, only one check can be enabled/disabled: when
I<laxmid> is mentioned in the values of this new parameter, INN accepts
Message-IDs that contain C<..> in the left part, as well as Message-IDs
with two C<@> (such Message-IDs would otherwise be considered as
syntactically invalid).  See the inn.conf(5) man page for more details.

The check is disabled by default (I<no-laxmid>), which corresponds to
the legacy behaviour of S<INN 2.6.1> and earlier.

=item *

Use of the B<ovdb_server> helper server is now the default when
using the ovdb overview method, that is to say the default value
for the I<readserver> parameter in F<ovdb.conf> is now set to true.
It improves stability and avoids deadlocks, timing issues and corrupted
ovdb databases.

=item *

B<mailpost> now removes empty header fields before attempting
to post articles, and keeps trace of them in the newly generated
X-Mailpost-Empty-Hdrs header field body.  Also, B<mailpost> now sanitizes
header fields with regards to empty continuation header lines.  Thanks to
Kamil Jonca for these bug reports.

=item *

A new B<-z> parameter has been added to B<mailpost> to mention a list
of header fields to remove from the gated message.  Thanks to Dieter
Stussy for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<inews> that was rejecting articles containing header
fields whose length exceeded 998 bytes.  This limitation is for the
length of a single line of a header field (and not for the length of
the whole header field, as it was wrongly the case).

=item *

Added support for GnuPG's B<gpg> binary (in addition to B<gpgv>)
in B<pgpverify>.  Indeed, B<gpg> still validates signatures made
with weak digest algorithms like MD5 whereas B<gpgv> no longer does.
Thanks to Thomas Hochstein for the patch, which permits validating
control articles for hierarchies that are still using old PGP keys.

=item *

Added similar support for GnuPG's B<gpg> binary in B<perl-nocem> to
validate NoCeM notices from issuers who are still using old PGP keys.

=item *

A few commands listed in the "Control commands to INND" section in
daily Usenet reports were appearing as a mere letter; all of them are
now properly converted to meaningful words.

=item *

The I<tlsprotocols> parameter in F<inn.conf> now recognizes the
C<TLSv1.3> value (for OpenSSL versions implementing S<TLS 1.3>, that
is to say starting from S<OpenSSL 1.1.1>).

=item *

The buffindexed overview method will now hopefully work properly on
systems with a native page size larger than 16KB.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.1 (2016-11-27)

=over 2

=item *

B<nnrpd> now uses C<-0000> as the time zone for Date and Injection-Date
header fields it generates.  It was previously using C<+0000>, wrongly
systematically indicating a local time zone at Universal Time when
I<localtime> is set to false (which is the default) in F<readers.conf>.
The C<+0000> time zone will now be used only if I<localtime> is set to
true and UTC is really the local time zone of the server.

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<nnrpd> the new COMPRESS command
described in the I<draft-murchison-nntp-compress> Internet-Draft that
extends the NNTP protocol to allow a connection to be effectively and
efficiently compressed.  News clients that also support that extension
will be able to benefit from that bandwidth optimization and improvement
in speed.  Moreover, using COMPRESS is more secure than TLS-level
compression, as far as authentication credentials are concerned.

=item *

The default value for the I<tlscompression> parameter in F<inn.conf>
has changed.  TLS-level compression is now disabled by default, to comply
with the best current practices for a secure use of TLS in application
protocols like NNTP.  Using the new COMPRESS command is recommended.

=item *

The I<tlscompression> parameter in F<inn.conf> now also permits
disabling TLS-level compression with S<OpenSSL 0.9.8>.  It previously
had an effect only when S<OpenSSL 1.0.0> or later was used.

=item *

B<rnews> no longer segfaults at startup when started setuid news.
Thanks to Marcus Jodorf for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed slow B<nnrpd> responses for a few NNTP commands.  The C<TCP_NODELAY>
option was unconditionally set whereas only BSD/OS systems needed it.
Thanks to Christian Mock for having discovered that.

=item *

Articles containing a Received or a Posted header field are no longer
rejected by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

Articles containing control characters or whitespace-only content lines
in their headers are now rejected by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

S<OpenSSL 1.1.0> support has been added to INN.

=item *

When an encryption layer is negotiated during a successful use of the
STARTTLS command, or after a successful authentication using an SASL
mechanism that negotiates an encryption layer, B<nnrpd> now updates
the permissions of the news client according to the new secure state
of his connection (that is to say auth blocks in F<readers.conf> using
the I<require_ssl> parameter are taken into account).  Previously,
only connections on a dedicated port (usually 563) were taking benefit
from that parameter.  Thanks to Steve Crook for the bug report.

=item *

When a data integrity layer was negotiated during a successful SASL
authentication, B<nnrpd> was wrongly reseting any knowledge obtained
from the client, such as the current newsgroup and article number.
This behaviour now applies only when an encryption layer is negotiated.

=item *

B<nntpsend> now correctly waits until all of the child B<innxmit>
processes exit before it does.  It was causing B<nntpsend> to fail
to work properly on systems that use systemd, because when it exits
prematurely, systemd kills all of the processes it launched, including
the B<innxmit> processes.  Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for the patch.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6

The following changes require your full attention because a manual
intervention may be needed:

=over 2

=item *

The name and location of the B<pullnews> configuration file have changed.
It is now F<pullnews.marks>, located in I<pathdb> when B<pullnews> is
run as the news user, or otherwise in the running user's home directory.
This file was previously stored in F<.pullnews> in the running user's
home directory (even for the news user).  If you use B<pullnews>, you
need to manually move and rename the configuration file; otherwise,
it will no longer work.  Note that the B<-c> flag passed to B<pullnews>
allows specifying another configuration file, if need be.

=item *

The default location of the B<mailpost> database directory has changed
from I<pathtmp> to I<pathdb>.  If you use B<mailpost> without an
explicitly specified database directory (using the B<-b> flag), then you
should manually move your current database files F<mailpost-msgid.dir>
and F<mailpost-msgid.pag> from I<pathtmp> to I<pathdb>.

=item *

If you have been using TLS/SSL with B<nnrpd> before, be aware that the
default value of a few F<inn.conf> parameters have changed: the server
now decides the preferred cipher (instead of the client), and only TLS
protocols are allowed (using the flawed SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols is
now disabled).  If you want to change these settings, the respective
I<tlspreferserverciphers> and I<tlsprotocols> parameters can be tuned
to your needs.

=item *

The B<--with-kerberos> C<configure> flag used to add S<Kerberos v5>
support has been renamed to B<--with-krb5>.

=item *

The B<--with-berkeleydb> C<configure> flag used to add S<Berkeley DB>
support has been renamed to B<--with-bdb>.

=item *

The B<--enable-ipv6> C<configure> flag no longer exists.  IPv6 is now
unconditionally enabled, if available.

=item *

C<$HOME> is no longer exported as an environment variable by B<innshellvars>,
B<innshellvars.tcl> and the Perl module C<INN::Config>.  It was previously
overriding the default user home directory with I<pathnews>.  If you use
these scripts in your own scripts, you will have to take care of that change.

=item *

Owing to the implementation of S<RFC 4643> (AUTHINFO USER/PASS) in B<innd>,
if remote peers have to authenticate in order to feed articles, they now
have to send a username (which was previously wrongly optional), before
sending their password.  The mandatory username, though currently unused
by B<innd>, can be whatever the remote peer wishes.  In previous versions
of INN, B<inncheck> was already complaining when F<passwd.nntp> contained
an empty username associated with a password.

A manual review of authenticated feeds should then be done so as to ensure
that they are properly working.

=item *

The Injection-Date and Injection-Info header fields are now generated
by B<nnrpd> at injection time instead of the NNTP-Posting-Date,
NNTP-Posting-Host, X-Complaints-To and X-Trace header fields.  Local
scripts that were using (for authentication, privacy, etc.) these now
deprecated header fields should be updated.  Also note that the Path
header field of locally posted articles can also contain the contents
of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Host header field.

=item *

The two I<addnntppostingdate> and I<addnntppostinghost> parameters in
F<inn.conf> have been respectively renamed to I<addinjectiondate> and
I<addinjectionpostinghost>.  B<innupgrade> takes care of the modification
only for F<inn.conf>; a manual change will therefore be needed for
F<readers.conf>, if these parameters are overridden in this file.

=item *

The default values of a few F<inn.conf> parameters have changed to make
use of the vastly expanded storage and RAM commonly available today:
I<datamovethreshold> (from C<8192> to C<16384>), I<msgidcachesize> (from
C<16000> to C<64000>), I<overcachesize> (from C<64> to C<128>), and
I<wireformat> (now enabled by default).

The generation of status reports and performance timings are now also
enabled by default: I<logstatus> and I<nnrpdoverstats> parameters, with a
frequency of 10 minutes (I<status> and I<timer> parameters).

=item *

The default value of I<max-queue-size> has changed from C<5> to C<20>, and
I<use-mmap> now defaults to true for F<innfeed.conf>.

=back

L<Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5>.

=head1 Changes in 2.6.0 (2015-09-12)

=over 2

=item *

The NNTP protocol requires a username to be sent before a password when
authentication is used.  B<innd> was wrongly allowing only a password to
be sent by authenticated peers.  See the note above for more details.

=item *

The Lines header field is no longer generated by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

The Injection-Date header field is now generated by B<nnrpd> at injection
time instead of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Date header field, when
I<addinjectiondate> is set to true.  Note that I<addnntppostingdate>
has been renamed to I<addinjectiondate> in F<inn.conf>.

=item *

The Injection-Info header field is now generated by B<nnrpd> at injection time
instead of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Host (when I<addinjectionpostinghost>
is set to true), X-Complaints-To and X-Trace header fields.  Note that
I<addnntppostinghost> has been renamed to I<addinjectionpostinghost>
in F<inn.conf>.  The Path header field of locally posted articles now also
contains the contents of the NNTP-Posting-Host header field.

=item *

A new I<addinjectionpostingaccount> parameter has been added in
F<inn.conf>.  When set to true, the Injection-Info header field
contains an additional I<posting-account> attribute that mentions the
username assigned to the user at connection time or after authentication.
The default value for this parameter is false.

=item *

A few header fields are now considered as obsolete by B<nnrpd> at injection
time: NNTP-Posting-Date, NNTP-Posting-Host, X-Complaints-To, X-Trace,
Also-Control, Article-Names, Article-Updates, and See-Also header fields.

Besides, B<nnrpd> will similarly reject obsolete I<sendsys>, I<senduuname>
and I<version> control messages.

=item *

The presence of a Subject header field beginning with C<cmsg > no longer
causes an article to be interpreted as a control message by B<nnrpd>
at injection time.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer differentiates IHAVE from POST.  Articles injected
with IHAVE are now treated as though they were injected with POST.
It means that if the previous behaviour of IHAVE was expected, B<innd>
should handle itself the connection instead of B<nnrpd>.

=item *

The name of the B<pullnews> configuration file is now F<pullnews.marks>
located in I<pathdb> when B<pullnews> is run as the news user, or
otherwise in the running user's home directory.  It was previously
stored in F<.pullnews> in the running user's home directory (even for
the news user).

=item *

Fixed a leak of semaphores when using buffindexed.  Thanks to Richard
Kettlewell for having fixed the issue.

=item *

Building with Libtool is no longer optional.  The B<--enable-libtool>
option to C<configure> has been removed.

=item *

C<DESTDIR> and non-root installs are now properly supported and documented
in F<INSTALL>.  The C<make install>, C<make update> and C<make cert>
steps properly obey C<DESTDIR>.  Besides, it is no longer a requirement
that the installation step be done by the superuser, as long as the
user executing the install has supplied a C<DESTDIR> value that points
to a writable directory, I<and> the person or process performing the
install corrects the file ownerships when INN is installed on the system
on which it's going to run.  Thanks to James Ralston for this support.

=item *

When building INN with S<Berkeley DB>, Cyrus SASL, S<Kerberos
v5>, OpenSSL, or zlib support, no longer add standard locations to
compiler and linker include flags.  Such default paths are now added
only if explicitly given to one or more of the B<--with-bdb>,
B<--with-bdb-include>, B<--with-bdb-lib>, B<--with-sasl>,
B<--with-sasl-include>, B<--with-sasl-lib>, B<--with-krb5>,
B<--with-krb5-include>, B<--with-krb5-lib>, B<--with-openssl>,
B<--with-openssl-include>, B<--with-openssl-lib>, B<--with-zlib>,
B<--with-zlib-include>, or B<--with-zlib-lib> C<configure> flags (the
flags ending with C<-include> and C<-lib> are new in S<INN 2.6.0>).

=item *

If the S<Berkeley DB>, Cyrus SASL, S<Kerberos v5>, or OpenSSL SSL
and crypto libraries are found at configure time, INN will now be
built with support for them unless respectively the B<--without-bdb>,
B<--without-sasl>, B<--without-krb5>, or B<--without-openssl> flags
are explicitly passed to C<configure>.

Note that it was already the default behaviour for zlib support when
S<Berkeley DB> support was also enabled.

=item *

The C<configure> flag B<--enable-reduced-depends> has been added to request
that library probes assume shared libraries are in use and dependencies
of libraries should not be probed.  It therefore tries to minimize the
shared library dependencies of the resulting binaries on platforms with
proper shared library dependencies.  This is not enabled by default, and
is of interest primarily to people building packages for distributions.

=item *

Building INN with Python support now requires the use of S<Python 2.2.0>
or later as the distutils.sysconfig module used was introduced with
S<Python 2.2.0>.

=item *

The INN test suite driver is now fully synchronized with the upstream
version of the C TAP Harness package maintained by Russ Allbery.
Keeping the INN test suite driver up-to-date will be possible thanks
to a new B<getc-tap-harness> script in the F<support> directory that
automatically fetches the latest upstream changes.

Similarly, the new B<getrra-c-util> script permits keeping most of
the utility and portability functions synchronized with the upstream
version of the rra-c-util package maintained by Russ Allbery.

New F<inn.conf> parameters used by B<nnrpd> to fine-tune the TLS/SSL
configuration have been added: I<tlsciphers>, I<tlscompression>,
I<tlseccurve>, I<tlspreferserverciphers>, and I<tlsprotocols>.
Many thanks to Christian Mock for his contribution that permits
tightening the level of security provided by TLS/SSL.

=item *

B<innwatch> no longer creates a child process only for sleeping and then
waits on that process.  The forked-off process only died after it had
done sleeping, which caused the INN service to drop into maintenance
state when for instance running under SMF on illumos/Solaris (since
not all processes die within timeout).  Thanks to Lauri Tirkkonen for
the patch.

=item *

B<innd> no longer crashes if a channel is supposed to sleep but does not
define a waker callback function.  Also, the highest file descriptor of
sleeping channels is now properly updated.  Thanks to Petr Novopashenniy
for the bug report.

=item *

Add new B<-i> flag to both B<cnfsstat> and B<innwatch> to specify
how many seconds they should sleep at startup.  It will especially be
useful in B<rc.news> so that these scripts are actually started and then
sleep by themselves, instead of being started a minute after B<innd>
and therefore not being properly stopped if C<rc.news stop> is invoked
during that minute.

=item *

Add new B<-f> flag to B<innwatch> to specify the configuration file to
use, in case it is not the default F<innwatch.ctl> file.

=item *

Add new B<-t> flag to B<mailpost> to change, if needed, the default
directory to use to temporarily store error messages that are sent to
the newsmaster.  Two paths are now tried by default: I<pathtmp> as
set in F<inn.conf>, and then F</var/tmp> if I<pathtmp> is not writable.

=item *

When the creation of a newsgroup needed expanding the tradindexed group
index, an already-running B<nnrpd> was not automatically noticing newly
created newsgroups.  Richard Kettlewell fixed that issue.

=item *

Fixed flushing of CNFS buffers when using NFS storage.

=item *

Fixed how B<innupgrade> is executed during an update of an INN
installation; on a few systems like AIX, it fails to run because its
taint mode was improperly declared.

=item *

Several improvements have been contributed to B<pullnews> by Geraint
Edwards: the new B<-a> flag adds the Diablo-compatible hashfeed
ability, the new B<-B> flag triggers header-only feeding, the B<-m>
flag now permits removing header fields matching (or not) a given regexp,
and B<rnews> reporting is improved.

=item *

B<innreport> now properly takes into account the time B<nnrpd> spends
writing when using SASL.


=item *

B<scanlogs> now only shows the first 50 lines from error log files.
Otherwise, all of them were present verbatim in the daily report,
and the resulting e-mail could bounce owing to its length.  Thanks to
Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed the use of the legacy AUTHINFO GENERIC command, that has been
broken since S<INN 2.4.0> (therefore proving readers probably no longer
use that method to authenticate).  Thanks to Richard Kettlewell for
having noticed, though, and contributed to tighten the security of the
replies of this command.

=item *

Add the B<nnrp.access2readers.conf> contribution script written by
Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> to convert old-style F<nnrp.access> file to
F<readers.conf>.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.4 (2014-05-17)

=over 2

=item *

An up-to-date F<control.ctl> file is provided with this release.  You should
manually update your F<control.ctl> file with the new information recorded
about Usenet hierarchies.

=item *

A test has been improved in F<innwatch.ctl> so that B<innwatch> no
longer throttles B<innd> when no overview directory exists.  You should
manually update your F<innwatch.ctl> file to get this improvement.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing limitation on how B<controlchan> and B<pgpverify>
were checking the signer of control messages.  They now properly handle
the case of several UIDs being defined on a single PGP key, as well
as the presence of spaces into UIDs.  In previous versions of INN,
a few valid control messages got ignored because of that limitation
(fido.ger.* and grisbi.* were for instance impacted).

=item *

As the name of the F<radius.conf> configuration file shipped with INN
for the B<nnrpd> authenticator against a RADIUS server conflicts with
the libradius package, this file is renamed to F<inn-radius.conf>
(B<innupgrade> takes care of the rename during the update).

=item *

The attributes hash is now accessible to B<nnrpd> Perl posting filter.
As a result, F<filter_nnrpd.pl> can make use of it.  Only authentication
and access Perl hooks could previously use the attributes hash.
Thanks to Steve Crook for this addition.

=item *

INN now properly builds fine with S<Flex 2.5.36> (this version
introduced a change of type for a variable used by INN).

=item *

When using funnel feeds, B<innfeed> log files were open forever, which
resulted in empty log files, once rotated by B<scanlogs>.  B<innfeed>
now reopens its log files upon receiving a HUP signal; this signal
is in particular sent by B<scanlogs> during log rotation.  Thanks to
Florian Schlichting for the patch.

=item *

Exploder and process channels are now reopened when C<ctlinnd flushlogs>
is used.  Otherwise, they could hold open an already deleted F<errlog>
file.  The issue affected in particular B<controlchan> or B<ninpaths>,
running as such channels.

=item *

Fixed a buffer overflow when using B<imapfeed> with more than a million
commands during the same IMAP session.  Thanks to David Binderman for
the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a segfault occurring in B<innd> on systems where time_t is a
64-bit integer.  Thanks to S<S.P. Zeidler> for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a segfault occurring in B<nnrpd> when a res block was used in
F<readers.conf> without the I<program> key.

=item *

Fixed an issue where users were denied posting because of an overlapping
buffer copy in a check B<nnrpd> was doing.  Thanks to Florian Schlichting
for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a regression that occurred in S<INN 2.5.3> regarding the path used
by default by B<pullnews> for its configuration file.  Instead of looking
in the running user's home directory, it was looking in the I<pathnews>
directory set in F<inn.conf>.  Thanks to Tony Evans for the bug report.

=item *

When neither B<wget> nor B<ncftpget> nor B<ncftp> was found at configure
time, the path to the B<simpleftp> substitution program shipped with
INN was not properly set in B<innshellvars>, B<innshellvars.pl>, and
the C<INN::Config> Perl module.  Thanks to Christian Garbs for the
bug report.

=item *

B<ckpasswd> no longer tries to use the ndbm compatibility layer provided
by S<Berkeley DB> if S<Berkeley DB> has been built without ndbm support.
Also add support for gdbm libraries in B<ckpasswd>.

=item *

Fixed a Perl warning in B<inncheck>; using C<defined(@array)> has been
deprecated since S<Perl 5.16>.

=item *

Fixed the occurrence of an unexpected C<cant select> error generated by
B<innd>.  Thanks to Paul Tomblin for having caught that long-standing
issue.

=item *

When building INN with S<Berkeley DB> support, no longer add
C<-L/usr/lib> to the linker include flags; unconditionally adding it
may break the build on systems using F<lib32> and F<lib64> directories.

=item *

On a fresh INN install, F<motd.innd> and F<motd.nnrpd> are no longer
installed by default.  Instead, samples for these files are provided
in I<pathetc>, named differently so that their default contents are
not displayed to news clients before they get customized.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements (like the addition
in the F<readers.conf> man page of the I<log> and I<program> parameters in
res blocks, and the I<include> directive).

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.5.3 (2012-06-15)

Please note that the C<HTML_STATUS> compile-time option has been replaced
with the I<htmlstatus> parameter in F<inn.conf>.  If you used C<HTML_STATUS>,
you should set I<htmlstatus> accordingly.

A confusion in the name of a key in F<innfeed.conf> existed in the source
code.  Make sure that the misspelled, undocumented I<backlog-limit-high>
key is *not* used in your F<innfeed.conf> file; its real name is
I<backlog-limit-highwater>.  You should rename the key in case it is present
in your configuration file.  Otherwise, it will not be taken into account.
You can run B<inncheck> to verify that the syntax of this file is correct.

It is generally recommended to run B<inncheck> after any changes done to
configuration files, especially with the new improved version of this script
shipped with S<INN 2.5.3>, thanks to the hard work of Florian Schlichting
who added support for the syntax of F<incoming.conf>, F<innfeed.conf>,
F<readers.conf> and F<storage.conf>.

An up-to-date F<control.ctl> file is provided with this release.  You should
manually update your F<control.ctl> file with the new information recorded
about Usenet hierarchies.

=over 2

=item *

When HDR/XHDR/XPAT were used on a new article coming into a newsgroup,
requesting a header field not present in the overview database, the first
subsequent OVER/XOVER command did not show that article.  A remap of the
overview data file was missing in B<nnrpd>.  Thanks to Sam Varshavchik
for the bug report.

=item *

When a header field appeared more than once in an article, it was missing
from the overview data.  OVER/XOVER, as well as HDR/XHDR/XPAT using the
overview, were therefore returning an empty field.  The content of the
first occurrence is now returned, in accordance with S<RFC 3977>.

Perl and Python filters for B<innd> now also properly initialize their
header field variables with the first occurrence of header fields.  (It is
still the last occurrence for the Perl filter for B<nnrpd>.)

=item *

Fixed a possible plaintext command injection during the negotiation
of a TLS layer.  The vulnerability detailed in CVE-2011-0411 (and
CVE-2012-3523, specifically for INN) affects the STARTTLS and AUTHINFO
SASL commands.  B<nnrpd> now resets its read buffer upon a successful
negotiation of a TLS layer.  It prevents malicious commands, sent
unencrypted, from being executed in the new encrypted state of the
session.

=item *

Fixed a regression that occurred in S<INN 2.5.0> when leading whitespace
characters have been made significant in header field bodies.  It could
lead INN to drop articles and throttle itself when running as a slave
because Xref header fields generated by other news servers, or even S<INN
2.4.6>, could contain (valid) leading whitespace.  Thanks to Matija Nalis
for having caught this bug.

=item *

Fixed an invalid C<431> response to CHECK commands when B<innd> is paused:
the Message-ID of the article to defer was missing.  Also fixed another
issue in the messages B<innd> replied; when an error occurred during a
write on a channel, a trailing extra junk byte was added to the reply.
Thanks to River Tarnell for these bug reports.

=item *

It is now possible to properly generate daily statistics with B<sendinpaths>
thanks to the new B<-k> and B<-r> flags that permit controlling the interval
of days for processing dump files.  The new B<-c> flag permits sending a
copy of the generated e-mail to the newsmaster.

Also fixed an issue with statistics that could be missing or duplicated
for a couple of days when monthly sent.

The documentation has been updated and mentions a preferred daily run of
B<sendinpaths>.  This script is a complete rewrite in Perl, and is based
on Mohan Kokal's initial work.

=item *

B<cnfsheadconf> now properly recognizes continuation lines in
F<cycbuff.conf>, that is to say lines ending with a backslash (C<\>).
Thanks to John S<F. Morse> for the bug report.

=item *

The order of CNFS buffers in a metacycbuff is now properly read and written
by B<cnfsheadconf>.  There previously was a confusion between hexadecimal
and decimal values.  Thanks again to John S<F. Morse>.

=item *

When the B<-l> flag is given to B<cnfsstat>, the F<cycbuff.conf> and
F<storage.conf> files are now reloaded if they have been modified since
the previous output of B<cnfsstat>.

=item *

A single header field line is limited to 998 bytes, per S<RFC 5536>.  B<innd>
was previously accepting, and also generating Xref header field lines,
up to 1022 bytes.  Now, B<nnrpd> (acting as an injecting agent) rejects
articles which contain header field lines whose length exceeds 998 bytes.
And B<innd> (acting as a relaying or serving agent) no longer checks that.

=item *

B<nnrpd> advertises the COUNTS, DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD and
SUBSCRIPTIONS variants of the LIST command in response to CAPABILITIES.
These commands already existed in B<nnrpd> but S<RFC 6048> had not yet
been published.

=item *

Add support for LIST MOTD in B<innd>.  Consequently, the F<motd.news>
configuration file which was previously used only by B<nnrpd> is renamed
to F<motd.nnrpd> (B<innupgrade> takes care of the rename).  B<innd> uses
the new F<motd.innd> file in I<pathetc> for its message of the day.

=item *

Fixed an issue at configure time that made INN wrongly assume that OpenBSD
(4.6) didn't support Unix-domain sockets.  Thanks to Wim Lewis for the patch.

=item *

Fixed an issue on systems which do not have a working flock(2) function
(Solaris, for instance).  B<mailpost> and B<pullnews> are reported not to
be usable on such systems.  Many thanks to Dennis Davis for the bug report.

A wrapper around B<shlock> is now called in Perl scripts.  The
C<INN::Utils::Shlock> module has been added for that use.

=item *

Fixed an issue in the Python access hook for B<nnrpd>: it has not been
working since S<Python 2.5> on 64-bit platforms, owing to a change to
Python's C API, using a new Py_ssize_t type definition instead of int.
Thanks to Raphael Barrois for the patch.

=item *

Improve the stability of the Perl filters for B<innd> and B<nnrpd>:
properly save and restore the stack pointer when needed.

=item *

The Injection-Date header field, when present, is now used by B<innd> and
B<makehistory> to determine the posting date of an article.  Otherwise,
the Date header field is used.

=item *

B<controlchan> now imposes a date cutoff on processing control articles.
The I<artcutoff> parameter set in F<inn.conf> is used.  Otherwise, without
that cutoff, old control articles could be maliciously reinjected into
Usenet, and replayed.  (An unsigned Injection-Date header field could be
added to an article that only had a Date header field.)  A new B<-c> flag
has been added to B<controlchan> to disable the cutoff check, if needed
(usually when manually invoking the program).

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer adds or updates the Path header field when an article is
forwarded to a moderator.  It could otherwise lead to rejects at injection
time when the article was approved by the moderator.

=item *

The X-Trace header field was not properly generated when an article
was locally posted.  The field mentioning the IP address was skipped,
resulting in a wrong syntax for this header field.  The local C<127.0.0.1> IP
address is now used.  Besides, C<localhost> is now mentioned instead of
an obscure C<stdin> in injection header fields.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the frequency B<innfeed> logs its status: too many useless
lines were written to F<news.notice>.  Thanks to Florian Schlichting for
the fix.

=item *

When unset in F<innfeed.conf>, the I<dynamic-method> parameter now
properly defaults to C<3> (instead of C<0>) and I<use-mmap> to false
(instead of true).  These two values were already the recommended ones in
the documentation and the sample file.  Note that I<use-mmap> is only used
when B<innfeed> is given file names to send instead of storage API tokens,
which is a fairly rare use case.

=item *

B<innfeed> no longer generates an error message (logged in F<news.err>) when
a parameter is not defined in F<innfeed.conf>.  All the parameters have a
default value, so there is no need to warn the user if they are not present
in F<innfeed.conf>.  Thanks to Dieter Stussy for having reported this problem.

=item *

Implement an upper limit to the number of file descriptors B<innd>
can handle.  At most C<(FD_SETSIZE-1)> file descriptors can be used.  This
upper limit now overrides any superior number set with I<rlimitnofile>
in F<inn.conf>.  Thanks to Steve Crook for the bug report.

=item *

A default timeout on outgoing sockets (using C<NNTPconnect>) has been added
by Florian Schlichting.  For a long time, there have been occasional
problems with B<actsync> (and probably other programs) that would hang
until manually killed or restarted.

=item *

The flag B<-S> has been added to B<innd> by Florian Schlichting.  When used,
B<innd> reports the errors found in F<incoming.conf> and exits.

=item *

B<pullnews> no longer stops processing newsgroups when an error occurs during
its run (for instance when a newsgroup mentioned in the configuration file
is removed from an upstream server).  Besides, it can now use authentication
when posting to the downstream server.

A few other minor bugs have been fixed as for the way B<pullnews> counts
the articles.

=item *

Fixed the way B<innreport> handles leap years.  It now properly generates
HTML reports; dates were assumed to be relative to the current year, which
may break their computation during for instance the whole 2012 leap year.
Please note that no HTML reports have been lost, and that they will appear
when INN is updated to this new version.

=item *

A new parameter has been added to F<inn.conf> to determine whether the status
file that B<innd> can write out (depending on the value of the I<status>
parameter) is plain text or wrapped in HTML.  It previously only was a
compile-time option, set to true by default.  Florian Schlichting added
the I<htmlstatus> parameter to provide a configurable behaviour.

=item *

It is now possible to run a script at the end of the execution of
B<innshellvars> scripts.  If a file named F<innshellvars.local>,
F<innshellvars.pl.local> or F<innshellvars.tcl.local> is present and
executable in I<pathetc>, then it will be executed by the corresponding
B<innshellvars> script (respectively shell, C<INN::Config> Perl module,
and Tcl).  A typical use is to add or override variables.

=item *

Add support for wire-formatted articles in B<scanspool>.

=item *

A lot of work on cleaning old perl4-style code has been done by Florian
Schlichting.

=item *

B<inncheck> now generates a proper non-zero exit value when errors are found,
and allows quiet mode with the B<-q> flag.  Florian Schlichting has greatly
improved this script in many regards, especially with a config-syntax parser
for F<incoming.conf>, F<innfeed.conf>, F<readers.conf> and F<storage.conf>.

=item *

B<inncheck> now properly finds the boundaries of substituted variables in
F<newsfeeds> thanks to Alexander Bartolich.

=item *

B<docheckgroups> no longer uses AWK.  On a few systems, the script was
failing because of the presence of an old version of AWK that has a limit
in the size of the input it can handle.  Processing large newsgroups files
was consequently impossible.  B<docheckgroups> now uses Perl instead of AWK,
which solves the issue reported by S<John F. Morse>.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.  In particular, the
I<debug-shrinking>, I<fast-exit> and I<initial-sleep> keys in F<innfeed.conf>
are now documented.  The function C<filter_end()>, called when Perl filtering
is turned off, is also documented for the B<innd> and B<nnrpd> Perl filters.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.5.2 (2010-03-24)

The way checkpoints are handled by B<innreport> for B<innd> and B<innfeed>
has totally changed to provide more accurate daily statistics.  The first
Usenet report after an upgrade to S<INN 2.5.2> will probably contain
incorrect statistics for incoming and outgoing articles because the
beginning of the log files that will be used was generated by a previous
version of INN.

A new version of F<innreport.conf> is shipped with S<INN 2.5.2> but, in
order to preserve any local changes, will not be automatically installed
with C<make update>.  The changes are minor and not mandatory for the
upgrade.

=over 2

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<innd> the new version of the NNTP
protocol described in S<RFC 3977>, S<RFC 4643> and S<RFC 4644>, and
B<innd> now recognizes the CAPABILITIES command.  Despite these standards,
three commands (IHAVE, CHECK and TAKETHIS) will continue, for
interoperability reasons, to return a reject code (respectively C<435>,
C<438>, and C<439>) when the command contains a syntax error instead of
C<501>.  The mandatory username argument for authenticated peers is not
enforced in S<INN 2.5.2> but will be enforced by S<INN 2.6.0> when it
is released.

Major improvements are:

=over 2

=item *

B<innd> now has a decent parser for NNTP commands.  The parser is more
correct (commands like C<< IHAVEZ<><mid> >>, without a space between the
command and its argument, are no longer valid) and allows leading and
trailing whitespaces in commands.  B<innd> also now checks the length of
the NNTP command sent by the client.  If the command contains more than
512 bytes (or 497 bytes for an argument), an error is returned and the
command is discarded.  After ten unrecognized commands, B<innd> closes the
connection with the appropriate code (C<400> instead of C<500>).

=item *

The output of the HELP command specifies the arguments expected by NNTP
commands, similar to B<nnrpd>'s HELP command.

=item *

LIST ACTIVE, LIST ACTIVE.TIMES and LIST NEWSGROUPS now allow an optional
wildmat argument to restrict the results of those commands to specific
newsgroups.

=item *

When using HEAD or STAT with an article number or a range, C<412> (no
group selected) is now returned instead of C<501> (syntax error).

=back

=item *

Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> has implemented support in both B<innd> and B<nnrpd>
for whitespace in usernames/passwords provided with AUTHINFO USER/PASS.
They were previously treated as invalid arguments or incorrectly parsed.
B<innd> and B<nnrpd> now treat everything after the first whitespace
character following AUTHINFO USER/PASS, up to, but not including, the
final CRLF, as the username/password, in conformity with S<RFC 4643>.

=item *

The syntax of Message-IDs is now based on S<RFC 5536> (USEFOR) instead of
S<RFC 1036>.  The major change is that quoted-pairs have been removed from
the syntax.

=item *

The Perl and Python filters for B<innd> now check the Message-ID of
articles arriving through TAKETHIS.  Only CHECK and IHAVE commands
previously used them.

=item *

Case-insensitive matches are now used for distributions, path identities,
IMAP commands, header field names, and control commands.  (Newsgroups are still
matched case-sensitively.)  Message-IDs are case-sensitively matched,
except for history hashes.

=item *

The new Archive, Archive-At, Comments, and Summary header fields
defined in S<RFC 5064> and S<RFC 5536> can be used in B<innd> filters.
B<nnrpd> now checks at injection time that an article does not contain
an Injection-Info header field, that an Injection-Date header field (if
provided) is valid, and that the Path header field body does not contain
C<.POSTED>.  Note that INN does not yet generate these two injection
fields or include the new C<.POSTED> keyword in Path header fields.
These new features will be in the next major release of INN.

=item *

LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS now accepts an optional wildmat argument to restrict
the results of this command to specific newsgroups.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now supports a new LIST variant named COUNTS.  LIST COUNTS is a
combination of LIST ACTIVE and GROUP.  It returns the same result as LIST
ACTIVE except that the number of articles in a newsgroup is inserted
before its status.

=item *

A new flag has been added to F<newsfeeds> entries: C<Aj>, when present,
says to feed articles accepted and filed in C<junk> (due to I<wanttrash>)
to peers based on their F<newsfeeds> feed patterns applied to the
Newsgroups header field as though the article were accepted and all those
groups were locally carried.  This is useful if you want to run INN with a
minimal F<active> file and propagate all posts.  Thanks to Andrew Gierth
for the patch.

=item *

A new parameter has been added to F<inn.conf>: I<logtrash> defines whether
a line for articles posted to groups not locally carried by the news
server should be added in the F<news> log file to report unwanted
newsgroups.  The default is true but it can be useful to set it to false
(especially when I<wanttrash> is also used).

=item *

The B<procbatchdir> keyword has been added to B<news.daily> to specify the
backlog directory of B<innfeed>.  This is useful when several instances of
B<innfeed> are running or when its configuration file is not the default
one.

=item *

B<sm> now supports a new flag, B<-c>, which shows a decoded form of the
storage API token.  This was previously done by the contrib B<showtoken>
script developed by Olaf Titz and Marco d'Itri.

=item *

The B<O> flag in F<newsfeeds> now relies on the contents of the
Injection-Info header field if it is present to determine the origin of
an article.  It falls back on X-Trace if there is no Injection-Info
header field.

=item *

A new "unsigned long" type bas been added to the configuration parser.  It
will properly warn the news administrator when a variable supposed to be
positive contains a negative integer.  It will prevent INN from crashing
due to misconfiguration at several places where it did not expect negative
values.

=item *

B<innxbatch> and B<innxmit> now recognize the new C<403> code introduced
by S<RFC 3977> for a problem preventing the requested action from being
taken.

=item *

HDR and OVER commands now return the correct C<423> code (instead of
C<420>) when the current article number is used but the article no longer
exists.

=item *

B<actsync>, B<inews>, B<innxbatch>, B<innxmit>, B<nntpget> and B<rnews>
can now authenticate to news servers which only expect a username, without
password, conforming to S<RFC 4643>.

=item *

The keyword generation code now generates a Keywords header field only if the
original article does not already have one.  The generated Keywords
header field no longer begins with a comma.  If keyword generation is set to
true in F<inn.conf> but the Keywords header field is not stored in the
overview, the news administrator is warned and keyword generation
deactivated, since it exists only to populate the overview data.

=item *

Two segfaults in keyword generation were fixed.  The first occurred when
an article already had a Keywords header field longer than the I<keylimit>
parameter.  The second was caused by a possible invalid pointer beyond the
newly allocated Keywords header field.

=item *

Fixed B<innd> handling of empty lines.  B<innd> was not properly
discarding an empty command and was closing the connection when it
received only whitespace in a command.

=item *

Fixed a bug in how B<innd> responded to reader commands when readers were
not allowed.  A superfluous blank line was sent in its response.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innd>'s response to TAKETHIS when authentication is
required.  Previously, C<480> code was returned immediately without
accepting the multi-line data block first, which broke synchronization in
the NNTP protocol.

=item *

Fixed a bug in recognizing the article terminator when empty articles were
fed to B<innd> via IHAVE or TAKETHIS, leading to treating subsequent NNTP
commands as part of the article.

=item *

When B<innd> could not provide information for LIST ACTIVE.TIMES and LIST
NEWSGROUPS, it was returning an invalid error message without a response
code.  The proper C<503> answer code is now returned.

=item *

When an unauthenticated user tried to post an article, B<nnrpd> replied
C<440> (posting not allowed) instead of the correct C<480> (authentication
required) response if the user might be able to post after authentication.
Thanks to Daniel Weber for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a bug in both B<innd> and B<nnrpd> answers to LIST commands where
the output was not checked for valid dot stuffing.

=item *

Fixed a bug leading to junked non-control articles being sent to
control-only feeds, and also fixed handling of poisoned control groups.
Thanks to Andrew Gierth for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innreport> leading to incorrect summing of B<innd> stats
when I<hostname> was set to an IPv6 address instead of a fully qualified
domain name.  Thanks to Petr Novopashenniy for the bug report.

=item *

Changed how B<innreport> uses B<innd> and B<innfeed> checkpoint messages.
Previously, connections held open for multiple days led to skewed and
incorrect statistics on how many articles had been received or sent.  The
count is now more accurate and, for each connection of a feed, only
depends on I<incominglogfrequency> in F<inn.conf> and I<stats-period> in
F<innfeed.conf>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<nnrpd> Perl filter: a header field whose name begins with
the name of a standardized header field was not properly handled.

=item *

Fixed a bug in how B<innd> was parsing Message-ID and Supersedes header
field bodies which contained trailing whitespace.  The article was
corrupted by an unexpected C<\r> in the middle of the header field body.
B<nnrpd> now checks the syntax of the Message-ID header field, if present.

=item *

Fixed various bugs in how leading whitespace was treated in header fields.  The
HDR, XHDR and XPAT commands were not properly showing leading whitespace
in header field bodies.  Lone C<\n> and C<\r> characters are now changed into
spaces and C<\r\n> is just removed.  B<archive>, B<makehistory>, and
B<tdx-util> now keep leading whitespace in header field bodies when generating
overview data, and B<archive> now changes C<\n> (when not preceded by C<\r>)
into a space when generating overview data.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the generation of overview data which may corrupt
previously generated overview data when a pseudo Xref header field is
injected in an extra overview field.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the parsing of the I<ovgrouppat> wildmat in F<inn.conf>
that prevented overview data from being generated when poisoned groups
were specified but a latter sub-pattern matched the group.  A uwildmat
expression is now correctly handled, and a potential segfault has been
fixed.  Thanks to Dieter Stussy for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a bug when HDR, XHDR and XPAT were used when I<virtualhost> was set
to true in F<readers.conf>.  The Xref header field of articles posted to only
one newsgroup appeared empty.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<tdx-util> in parsing empty overview fields when called
with B<-A> or B<-F>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<cvtbatch>, which was returning only the size of the
headers of an article when the C<b> parameter was used with the B<-w>
flag.  It now correctly returns the size of the whole article, which is
what C<b> was documented to do.  B<cvtbatch> also has a new C<t>
parameter, which can be used with the B<-w> flag to retrieve the arrival

Fixed a bug in how B<mailpost> handles cross-posting feature.  It was not
properly detaching from B<sendmail>.  Thanks to Harald Dunkel for the
patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the F<newsfeeds> B<C> flag: the count of followup groups
was one less than the real number.  When the value of the Followup-To
header field is C<poster>, it is no longer considered to be a followup.
Thanks to Dieter Stussy for the patch.

=item *

When using tradindexed, the overview data for a cancelled article is now
immediately removed from the overview.  Thanks to Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
for the patch.

=item *

B<batcher> has not supported the retrieval of an article with its file
name for a long time.  The B<-S> flag has therefore been removed.

=item *

B<inews> no longer rejects articles that contain more than 50 header
fields.  Thanks to Torsten Jerzembeck for the bug report.

=item *

B<news.daily> no longer sends superfluous mails when the B<nomail> keyword
is given.  Mail is only sent when there is real output.  Previously, there
would always be headings and empty lines left over from the structuring of
the full report, which are now omitted.  Also, the output of programs
executed with B<postexec> is now included in the regular mail.  Thanks to
Florian Schlichting for the patch.

=item *

B<innconfval> no longer maps NULL string or list values to an empty string
or list and instead maps them to undefined values.  This fixes an issue
reported by Kamil Jonca: B<nnrpd> was inserting an empty Organization
header field when the I<organization> parameter in F<inn.conf> was unset.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.1 (2009-10-10)

=over 2

=item *

Fixed a segfault in B<imap_connection> which could occur when SASL
was used.

=item *

Fixed a segfault in the keyword generation code which was assuming
that an article was nul-terminated.  Fixed another segfault in the
keyword generation code when an article already contained a
Keywords header field.  Thanks to Nix for the bug reports.

=item *

Owing to the US-CERT vulnerability note VU#238019, Cyrus SASL library
has slightly changed.  B<imap_connection> and B<nnrpd> now handle
that change.  Otherwise, some answers are too long to be properly
computed during SASL exchanges.

=item *

Fixed a memory allocation problem which caused B<nnrpd> to die when
retrieving via HDR/XHDR/XPAT the contents of an extra overview field
absent from the headers of an article.  The NEWNEWS command was also
affected on very rare cases.  Thanks to Tim Woodall for the bug report.

=item *

HDR/XHDR/XPAT answers are now robust when the overview database is
inconsistent.  When the overview schema was modified without the overview
database being rebuilt, wrong results could be returned for extra fields
(especially a random portion of some other header field).  The desired header
field name is now explicitly searched for in the overview information.

=item *

Fixed the source which is logged to the F<news> log file for local
postings when the local server is not listed in F<incoming.conf>.
A wrong name was used, taken amongst known peers.  The source is now
logged as C<localhost>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the timecaf storage method: only the first 65535 articles
could be retrievable in a CAF, though everything was properly stored.  (A
Crunched Article File contains all the articles that arrive to the news
server during 256 seconds.)

The storage token now uses 4 bytes to store the article sequence number
for timecaf, instead of only 2 bytes.  Thanks to Kamil Jonca for the
bug report and also the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in both timecaf and timehash which prevented them from working
on systems where short ints were not 16-bit integers.

=item *

When there is not enough space to write an entire CAF header, the timecaf
storage manager now uses a larger blocksize.  On 32-bit systems, the CAF header
is about 300 bytes, leaving about 200 bytes for the free bitmap index
(the remaining of a 512-byte blocksize).  On 64-bit systems, the size
of the CAF header could exceed 512 bytes, thus leaving no room for the
free bitmap index.  A S<1 KB> blocksize is then used, or a larger
size if need be.

=item *

A new CNFS version has been introduced by Miquel van Smoorenburg in
the CNFS header.  CNFSv4 uses S<4 KB> blocks instead of S<512 bytes>,
which more particularly makes writes faster.  CNFSv4 supports
files/partitions up to S<16 TB> with a S<4 KB> blocksize.

Existing CNFS buffers are kept unchanged; only new CNFS buffers are
initialized with that new version.

=item *

C<grephistory -l> now returns the contents of the expires history field
as well as the hash of the Message-ID.  Besides, when the storage API
token does not exist, C<grephistory -v> now also returns the hash
of the requested Message-ID.

=item *

The check on cancel messages when I<verifycancels> is set to true
in F<inn.conf> has been changed to verify that at least one newsgroup
in the cancel message can be found in the article to be cancelled.
This new feature is from Christopher Biedl.

The previous behaviour was to check whether the cancel message is
from the same person as the original post, which is extremely easy
to spoof; besides, S<RFC 5537> (USEPRO) mentions that "cancel control
messages are not required to contain From and Sender header fields
matching the target message.  This requirement only encouraged cancel
issuers to conceal their identity and provided no security".

=item *

The way the C</remember/> line in F<expire.ctl> works has changed.
History retention for an article was done according to its original
arrival time; it is now according to its original posting date.
Otherwise, unnecessary data may be kept too long in the F<history>
file.

To achieve that, the C<HISremember()> function in history API now
expects a fourth parameter: the article posting time.

Note that article expiration has not changed and is still based
on arrival time, unless the B<-p> flag is passed to B<expire>
or B<expireover>, in which case posting time is used.

=item *

The default value for C</remember/> has changed from C<10> to C<11>
because it should be one more than the I<artcutoff> parameter
in F<inn.conf>, so that articles posted one day into the future
are properly retained in history.

=item *

B<auth_krb5> has been rewritten by Russ Allbery to use modern
Kerberos APIs.  Note that using B<ckpasswd> with PAM support
and a Kerberos PAM module instead of this authenticator is still
recommended.

=item *

A new B<-L> flag has been added by Jonathan Kamens to B<makehistory>
so as to specify a load average limit.  If the system load average exceeds
the specified limit, B<makehistory> sleeps until it goes below the limit.

=item *

As UTF-8 is the default character set in S<RFC 3977>, C<ctlinnd pause>,
C<ctlinnd readers>, C<ctlinnd reject>, C<ctlinnd reserve>, C<ctlinnd throttle>
and C<nnrpd -r> commands now require the given reason to be encoded in UTF-8,
so that it can be properly sent to news readers.  The creator's name given
to C<ctlinnd newgroup> is also expected to be encoded in UTF-8.

=item *

The output of consistency checks for article storage and the F<history>
file no longer appears by default when C<cnfsstat -a> is used.  A new B<-v>
flag has been added to B<cnfsstat> so as to see it.

=item *

The default path for TLS certificates has changed from I<pathnews>/F<lib>
to I<pathetc>.  It only affects new INN installations or generations of
certificates with C<make cert>.  Besides, a default value has been
added to I<tlscapath> because it is required by B<nnrpd> when TLS
is used.

=item *

gzip(1) is now the default UUCP batcher in B<send-uucp> instead of
compress(1) because B<gzip> is more widely available than B<compress>,
due to old patent issues.  Note that there is no impact on decompression
as it is handled by B<rnews>.

=item *

B<cnfsheadconf> now uses the Perl core module C<Math::BigInt> rather
than the deprecated F<bigint.pl> library.  When used without specifying
a CNFS buffer, it now properly displays the status of all CNFS buffers.

=back

=head1 Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5

The following changes require your full attention because a manual intervention
may be needed:

=over 2

=item *

In order to process control messages, B<controlchan> now needs the
C<MIME::Parser> module.  Packages are available from most distributions,
or you can install the module directly from CPAN (C<MIME-tools> in
F<modules/by-module/MIME/>, for instance on ftp.perl.org).

S<Perl 5.8.0> or later is recommended for INN.  If you are using an earlier
version, you will also need the C<Encode> module for correct processing of
control messages.  (It is included with Perl itself in 5.8.0 and later.)

=item *

Checkgroups control messages are now differently handled by B<controlchan>:
all matching lines in F<control.ctl> will be used for a given checkgroups
and a B<doit> action will really be executed (adding, removing and changing
the status of newsgroups).  You should make sure that your local
configuration does not rely on the previous behaviour of only mailing
changes, without actually performing them.

=item *

You should use the new F<control.ctl.local> file shipped with INN in
I<pathetc> and, at the same time, update your F<control.ctl> and
F<moderators> files.  Also make sure that your F<active.times>,
F<distrib.pats> and F<newsgroups> files are properly encoded in UTF-8, as
it is strongly recommended by S<RFC 3977>.

=item *

The F<overview.fmt> file is no longer used by INN.  Two new parameters
have been added to F<inn.conf>: I<extraoverviewadvertised> and
I<extraoverviewhidden>.  Although B<innupgrade> takes care of the
change during C<make update>, you should make sure that your overview
database is consistent with all the fields declared in F<overview.fmt>
because they will all be advertised, and C<Xref:full> forced as the
eighth overview field.  See the inn.conf(5) man page for more information
about these parameters.

=item *

The B<innreport> configuration file has slightly changed.  The new
F<innreport.conf> file shipped with INN should be used and your possible
changes backported to this new version.

=item *

The C<$SPOOLBASE> variable has been renamed to C<$SPOOLDIR> in B<innshellvars>
in order to be more consistent.  It impacts shell scripts only.  If you
import B<innshellvars> and use that variable in your scripts, you will
have to rename it.

=item *

B<gpgverify> is no longer included in INN, B<pgpverify> now has better
support for GnuPG and should be used instead.

=item *

The B<auth_smb> authenticator program to check passwords with an SMB
authentication is no longer included in INN.  It was a stripped-down
version of pam_smbpass(5), wasn't maintained, and likely had security
problems.  To authenticate to an SMB server such as Samba, use PAM and
B<ckpasswd>'s PAM support instead.

=back

The parameters used by B<nnrpd> to provide TLS support are now
I<tlscafile>, I<tlscapath>, I<tlscertfile> and I<tlskeyfile> in
F<inn.conf>.  The F<sasl.conf> file used for that in previous versions of
INN is obsolete.  B<innupgrade> takes care of the change during C<make
update>.

The I<nntpactsync> parameter has been renamed to I<incominglogfrequency>
in F<inn.conf>; B<innupgrade> handles this renaming during the update.

In F<newsfeeds>, B<innfeed> should be run directly rather than through
B<startinnfeed>.  B<innupgrade> will attempt to take care of this
modification during C<make update>.

When starting B<innd> by hand, B<innd> can just be run directly rather
than using B<inndstart>.  If you get error messages about resetting the
file descriptor limits, you may need to increase the file descriptor
limits.  See the sample init script in F<contrib> for an example of how to
do this.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.4>, see also
L<Upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4>.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.0 (2009-05-21)

=over 2

=item *

Ken Murchison has contributed SASL authentication support for B<nnrpd>,
implementing the AUTHINFO SASL section of S<RFC 4643>.  If the
B<--with-sasl> option is given to C<configure>, B<nnrpd> will be able to
authenticate clients via secure SASL mechanisms.

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<nnrpd> the new version of the NNTP
protocol described in S<RFC 3977>, S<RFC 4642> and S<RFC 4643>.
Consequently, B<nnrpd> now recognizes the CAPABILITIES command, the
HDR and LIST HEADERS commands, the second optional argument to specify
a range of articles to LISTGROUP, the OVER command, as well as the
C<:bytes> and C<:lines> metadata items.

=item *

Heath Kehoe has added the ability to compress overview data before
it is stored in ovdb.  It significantly improves the performance
of this storage method and reduces the time spent by B<expireover>.
See the new B<--with-zlib> option to C<configure> and the ovdb(5)
man page.

=item *

Alexander Bartolich has greatly improved B<innreport> and especially
its XHTML output (an XSL transformation is also provided, if needed,
in F<innreport-filter.xslt>, in the F<contrib> directory).

=item *

B<inndstart> and B<startinnfeed> are no longer part of INN and are no
longer used.  Instead, a separate setuid root helper program written by
Russ Allbery is used to bind to the news ports (and does only that),
and is run by B<innd> and B<nnrpd> when necessary.  This means that INN
may not be able to increase file descriptor limits for itself the way
that it could before.  If you get error messages about resetting the file
descriptor limits, you may need to increase the file descriptor limits
as root before running B<rc.news> as the news user.  See the sample init
script in F<contrib> for an example of how to do this.  More information
on file descriptor limits can be found in F<INSTALL>.

=item *

INN's IPv6 support was largely rewritten by Russ Allbery.  IPv4 and IPv6
are now handled through the same code wherever possible, the new
IPv6-aware APIs are used everywhere possible, and replacement functions
are provided for systems that don't have them yet.  The network code is
now much more centralized, eliminating lots of duplicate code and adding
better IPv6 support to some utilities.

=item *

INN now uses S<Autoconf 2.61> or later for configuration.  As a result,
some C<configure> options have changed slightly and more of the standard
B<--*dir> options should be supported in lieu of the old INN-specific
options.  See C<configure --help> for the available options.

=item *

Thanks to Kirill Berezin, the buffindexed overview method now supports
buffers larger than S<2 GB>.  It is not necessary to compile INN with
large file support to use such large buffers with buffindexed.
Buffindexed is now also more robust with mmaped files and uses more
optimized data placement.

=item *

B<tinyleaf>, a miniature IHAVE-only leaf server written by Russ Allbery,
is now included.  See the tinyleaf(8) man page for more information.

=item *

B<controlchan> recognizes the new application/news-groupinfo entity
described in USEPRO and can handle character set conversions of newsgroup
descriptions.  The C<MIME::Parser> and C<Encode> modules are used.
Processing control messages has been greatly improved, especially
checkgroups: the F<active> and F<newsgroups> files are now properly
updated when they are processed, and all matching lines in F<control.ctl>
for a given checkgroups are honoured (which for instance allows using
both B<drop> and B<doit> actions for the same checkgroups message).

A new F<control.ctl.local> file has also been added in I<pathetc>.  Rules
set in that file override rules in F<control.ctl>, allowing administrators
to specify local rules for some control messages without modifying the
F<control.ctl> configuration file that comes with INN.  It also specifies
encodings to use for the F<newsgroups> file.  By default, UTF-8 will be
used for newsgroup descriptions, as strongly recommended by S<RFC 3977>.

=item *

The Perl and Python I<filter_mode> hooks are now called when B<innd> is
shutting down via either C<ctlinnd shutdown> or C<ctlinnd xexec> with a
new mode value of C<shutdown>.  This will allow the Perl hooks to save
filter data across B<innd> restarts without requiring that the news
administrator throttle the server first.  (Python already had a separate
close hook that is also called.)

=item *

The legacy B<innshellvars.pl> script has been replaced with a real INN
Perl module C<INN::Config> for Perl programs.  The location of Perl
modules can be set with the B<--with-libperl-dir> option to C<configure>.
All Perl scripts shipped with INN have been converted to use that module.
You may want to consider using C<INN::Config> in your Perl scripts, though
B<innshellvars.pl> is still provided with INN.

=item *

Support for embedded Tcl filters in B<innd> has been removed.  It hasn't
worked for some time and causes B<innd> crashes if compiled in (even if
not used).  If someone wants to step forward and maintain it, we recommend
starting from scratch and emulating the Perl and Python filters.

=item *

If I<strippath> is set in F<readers.conf>, the whole user-supplied Path
header field will now be stripped.  Previously, the final component of the
user-supplied Path header field body would still be retained.

=item *

B<news2mail> can now set the envelope-from address of the mails it sends.
A third optional part in F<news2mail.cf> entries has been added by
S<D. Stussy> to achieve that.

=item *

The B<-g> option to B<nnrpd> is no longer supported.  If you are verifying
passwords against the system password database, see the ckpasswd(8) man
page, and in particular the B<-s> option.  (A much better idea would be to
just use PAM, which B<ckpasswd> supports.)

=item *

Fixed a bug in C<ctlinnd renumber> which was resetting the low and high
water marks of empty newsgroups in the F<active> file.  This command
now makes the low water mark one more than the real high water mark.
The answers to LIST ACTIVE, GROUP and LISTGROUP have also been fixed
to do that.

=item *

Support for bzip2-compressed batches (with B<bunbatch>) has been added.

=item *

B<news.daily> now processes B<innfeed> dropped files during daily
maintenance, running B<procbatch>.

=item *

Support for I<runasuser> and I<runasgroup> parameters in F<inn.conf>
allows setting the news user and the news group under which the news server
runs.  Thanks to Ivan Shmakov for this feature.

New other options have been added to configuration files: I<ignore> in
F<incoming.conf>, I<logstatus>, I<nnrpdflags> and I<verifygroups> in
F<inn.conf>, and I<log-time-format> in F<innfeed.conf>.

The B<--with-http-dir> option has also been added to C<configure> to set
I<pathhttp> in F<inn.conf>.

The I<nntpactsync> parameter has been renamed to I<incominglogfrequency>
in F<inn.conf>.

=item *

The F<sasl.conf> file has been removed in favour of new parameters in
F<inn.conf> to deal with TLS support: I<tlscafile>, I<tlscapath>,
I<tlscertfile> and I<tlskeyfile>.

=item *

The F<overview.fmt> file has been removed in favour of new parameters
in F<inn.conf> to deal with transition periods to accommodate
overview reconfigurations.  It is now possible to specify on the one
hand the fields that should be advertised by B<nnrpd> in response to
LIST OVERVIEW.FMT and used for HDR, XHDR and XPAT requests (see the new
I<extraoverviewadvertised> parameter) and on the other hand the
additional fields that should be silently generated (see the new
I<extraoverviewhidden> parameter).

=item *

Support for S<Berkeley DB> versions prior to 4.3 has been dropped.  You
will have to use at least S<Berkeley DB 4.4>; the recommended version is
4.7.

=item *

INN now builds entirely free of warnings from GCC with fairly aggressive
warning options enabled.  This involved lots of cleanup of const strings,
signed versus unsigned type handling, correcting printf formats, and other
changes that fixed obscure bugs and made INN's code more robust.  Russ
Allbery has also done considerable cleanup work on some of INN's
internals, simplifying, refactoring, and removing duplicate code.

=item *

INN's test suite is now much more comprehensive and tests some high-level
functions as well as more of the portability and utility function layer.

=item *

A lot of work has been done on documentation: improvements of existing
documents, new documentation, and proof-reading.  Sample configuration
files are also more detailed.

=item *

All of the applicable bug fixes from the S<INN 2.4 STABLE> series are also
included in S<INN 2.5>.

=item *

Fixed the segfault of the radius authenticator when none of the radius
servers respond.  Thanks to Matija Nalis for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a lost initialization in buffindexed, which resolves a potential
segfault, thanks to a patch by Kirill Berezin.

=item *

INN now properly supports S<Perl 5.10.0> (and also 5.8.9); Perl filters
were causing B<innd> to segfault on a few systems like FreeBSD.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing bug which affected Perl hooks for B<innd>:
the variable containing the body of an article was not properly
created, which caused regular expressions matching new lines to fail.
It especially affected filters like Cleanfeed which sometimes
failed to detect unwanted articles.

To fix that issue, Julien Elie added the use of a shared string,
available since S<Perl 5.7.2>, with a fall back to a slower but
reliable copy of such bodies in case the function is not available.
Using a Perl version superior to 5.7.2 is therefore recommended.

=item *

Fixed two bugs which could prevent B<nnrpd> from being run as a daemon
in FreeBSD.  Thanks to Johan van Selst for having identified the
problem and to Kai Gallasch for having provided a testing FreeBSD server.
The listening address was not initialized to C<::0> or C<0.0.0.0> when
the B<-b> flag was not used and an incorrect size was given when IPv6
was enabled and the binding done using IPv4.

=item *

Some annoying assertion failures occurring in B<innfeed> have been fixed
by Russ Allbery and Julien Elie.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<mod-active> for aliased newsgroups.  Only C<=> was written
to the F<active> file.  Thanks to S<D. Stussy> for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug which caused B<innd> not to honour the B<Ad> flag in F<newsfeeds>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the IP address displayed for C<localhost> in B<innd>'s
status file.  It was not correctly initialized.

=item *

Fixed a permission issue: XHDR and XPAT were not checking the rights
the user had to read articles when accessing them by their Message-ID.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the replies of XHDR, XOVER and XPAT when the newsgroup
is empty.  Two initial replies were sent instead of one: the right C<420>
code followed by a wrong C<224> code.

=item *

When no newsgroup is selected, LISTGROUP now returns the right C<412> code
(instead of C<481>).

=item *

B<inncheck> now uses a range of permissions to see whether the file modes
are correctly set.  Therefore, different configurations depending on the
security the user wants to enforce on his system are possible.

=item *

A new improved version of B<docheckgroups> is shipped with INN.  The B<-u>
flag permits updating automatically the F<newsgroups> file (with a proper
number of tabulations and an alphabetical sort), removing obsolete
descriptions and adding new ones.  A second argument on command-line permits
specifying which newsgroups should not be checked, so as not to treat them.

=item *

An I<email=> keyword has been added by James Ralston to B<news.daily>
in order to supply another mail address than the one set at configure time
for Usenet daily reports.

=item *

An updated F<moderators> file with information about the aioe.*, perl.*
and si.* hierarchies is provided.

=item *

An updated F<control.ctl> file is provided.

INN supports S<Berkeley DB 4.7>, which is the recommended version
to use owing to various bugs affecting previous versions of S<Berkeley DB>.

=item *

Fixed the "alarm signal" around C<SSL_read> in B<nnrpd>: it allows
a proper disconnection of news clients which were previously hanging
when posting an article through an SSL connection.  Moreover, the
I<clienttimeout> parameter now works on SSL connections.  Thanks to
Matija Nalis for the patch.

=item *

C<SO_KEEPALIVE> is now implemented for SSL TCP connections on systems
which support it, allowing system detection and closing the dead
TCP SSL connections automatically after system-specified time.  Thanks
to Matija Nalis for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a segmentation fault when an article of a size greater than remaining
in the stack is retrieved via SSL.  Thanks to Chris Caputo for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a few segfaults and bugs which affected both Python B<innd> and
B<nnrpd> hooks.  They no longer check the existence of methods not used by
the hooked script.  An issue with Python exception handling was also fixed,
as well as a segfault fixed by Russ Allbery which happened whenever one
closes and then reopens Python in the same process.  Julien Elie also fixed
a bug when reloading Python filters (they were not always correctly reloaded)
and a segfault when generating access groups with embedded Python filters for
B<nnrpd>.  Many thanks to David Hlacik for its bug reports.

=item *

The F<nnrpd.py> stub file in order to test Python B<nnrpd> hooks, as
mentioned in their documentation, is now installed; only F<INN.py> was
previously installed in I<pathfilter>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in F<INN.py> and add missing methods to it.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing bug in B<innreport> which prevented it from
correctly reporting B<nnrpd> and B<innfeed> log messages.

=item *

Fixed a hang in Perl hooks on (at least) HP/PA since S<Perl 5.10>.

=item *

Fixed a compilation problem on some platforms because of C<AF_INET6> which
was not inside a C<HAVE_INET6> block in B<innfeed>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innfeed> which contained thrice the same IPs for each
peer; it unnecessarily slowed the peer IP rotation for B<innfeed>.  Thanks,
S<D. Stussy>, for having seen that.  Miquel van Smoorenburg provided the patch.

=item *

A new I<heavily> improved version of B<pullnews> is shipped with this INN
release.  This new version is provided by Geraint Edwards.  He added no
more than S<16 flags>, fixed some bugs and integrated the B<backupfeed>
contrib script by Kai Henningsen, adding again S<6 other> flags.  A
long-standing but very minor bug in the B<-g> option was especially fixed
and items from the to-do list implemented.  Many thanks again to Geraint
Edwards.

=item *

New header fields are accessible through Perl and Python B<innd> filtering
hooks.  You will find the exact list in the INN Python Filtering and
Authentication Hooks documentation (F<doc/hook-python>) and in Python
samples.  Thanks to Matija Nalis for this addition of new useful header fields.

=item *

New samples for Python B<nnrpd> hooks are shipped with INN: F<nnrpd_access.py>
for access control and F<nnrpd_dynamic.py> for dynamic access control.  The
F<nnrpd_auth.py> script is now only used for authorization control.  See the
F<readers.conf> man page for more information (especially the I<python_auth>,
I<python_access> and I<python_dynamic> parameters).  The documentation about
INN Python Filtering and Authentication Hooks has also been improved by
Julien Elie.

Fixed incomplete checking of packet sizes in the B<ctlinnd> interface in
the no-Unix-domain-sockets case.  This is a potential buffer overflow in
dead code since basically all systems INN builds on support Unix domain
sockets these days.  Also track the buffer size more correctly in the
client side of this interface for the Unix domain socket case.

=item *

Group blocks in F<incoming.conf> are now correctly parsed and no longer
cause segfaults when loading this file.

Fixed a problem with B<innfeed> continuously segfaulting on amd64 hardware
(and possibly on lots of 64-bit platforms).  Many thanks to Ollivier Robert
for his patch and also to Kai Gallasch for having reported the problem and
provided the FreeBSD server to debug it.

B<scanlogs> now rotates B<innfeed>'s log file, which prevents B<innfeed>
from silently dying when its log file reaches S<2 GB>.

=item *

S<Perl 5.10> support has been added to INN thanks to Jakub Bogusz.

=item *

Some news clients hang when posting an article through an SSL connection:
it seems that B<nnrpd>'s SSL routines make it wrongly wait for data
completion.  In order to fix the problem, the C<select()> wait is now
just bypassed.  However, the idle timer stat is currently not collected
for such connections.  Thanks to Kachun Lee for this workaround.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the display of the used compressor (C<cunbatch> was used
if arguments were passed to B<gzip> or B<bzip2>).

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<mailpost> and B<pullnews> which prevented useful error
messages to be seen.  Also add the B<-x> flag to B<pullnews> in order
to insert Xref header fields in articles which lack one.

=item *

If compiling with S<Berkeley DB>, use its ndbm compatibility layer for
B<ckpasswd> in preference to searching for a traditional dbm library.
INN also supports S<Berkeley DB 4.4>, 4.5 and 4.6 thanks to Marco d'Itri.

=item *

B<ovdb_init> now properly closes stdin/out/err when it becomes a daemon.
The issue was reported by Viktor Pilpenok and fixed by Marco d'Itri.

=item *

Added support for Diablo quickhash and hashfeed algorithms.
It allows distributing the messages among several peers (new B<Q> flag
for F<newsfeeds>).  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this
implementation in INN.

=item *

B<innd> now listens on separate sockets for IPv4 and IPv6 connections
if the C<IPV6_V6ONLY> socket option is available.  There might also be
operating systems that still have separate IPv4 and IPv6 TCP implementations,
and advanced features like TCP C<SACK> might not be available on v6 sockets.
Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this patch.

=item *

The two configuration options I<bindaddress> and I<bindaddress6> can now
be set on a per-peer basis for B<innfeed>.  Setting I<bindaddress6>
to C<none> tells B<innfeed> to never attempt an IPv6 connection to that
host.  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this patch.

=item *

Added an I<nnrpdflags> parameter to F<inn.conf> (modelled on the concept
of I<innflags>) to permit passing of command line arguments to instances
of B<nnrpd> spawned from B<innd>.

=item *

A new F<inn.conf> parameter called I<pathcluster> has been added:
it allows appending a common name to the Path header field body
on all incoming articles.  I<pathhost> and I<pathalias> (if set)
are still appended to the path as usual, but I<pathcluster>
is always appended as the last element (e.g. on the leftmost
side of the Path header field body).  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for
this feature.

=item *

B<simpleftp> has been rewritten to use C<Net::FTP>.  Indeed, F<ftp.pl>
is no longer shipped with S<Perl 5> and the script did not work.

=item *

B<perl-nocem> will now check for a timeout and re-open the socket
if required.  Additionally, B<perl-nocem> will switch to
C<cancel_ctlinnd> in case C<cancel_nntp> fails after sending
the Message-ID.  Thanks to Christoph Biedl for the patch.  A more
detailed documentation has also been written for perl-nocem(8).

=item *

The RADIUS configuration is now wrapped in a C<server {}> block in
F<radius.conf>.

=item *

Checkgroups when there is nothing to change no longer result in sending
a blank mail to administrators.  Besides, no mail is sent by B<controlchan>
for the creation of a newsgroup when the action is C<no change>.

=item *

Checkgroups are now properly propagated even though the news server
does not carry the groups they are posted to.

=item *

B<controlchan> and B<docheckgroups> now handle wire format messages
so that articles from the spool can be directly fed to them.

=item *

Newgroup control messages for existing groups now change their description.
If a mail is sent to administrators, it reminds them to update their
F<newsgroups> file.  It also warns when there are missing or obsolete
descriptions.  Furthermore, the F<newsgroups> file is now written prettier
(from one to three tabulations between the name of the group and its
short description) and to.* groups cannot be created.

=item *

The sample F<control.ctl> file has been extensively updated.

=item *

Fixed empty LISTGROUP replies which were not terminated.  Thanks to
David Canzi for the patch.

=item *

In response to a LIST [I<file>] command, if the file does not exist,
we assume it is not maintained and return C<503> instead of C<215> and
an empty file.  Moreover, capability to LIST ACTIVE.TIMES for a wildmat
pattern as its third argument has been added in order to select wanted
newsgroups.

=item *

B<inews> now tries to authenticate if it does not receive a C<200> return
code after MODE READER.  Indeed, it might be able to post even with
a C<201> return code and also with another codes like C<440> or C<480>.

=item *

If creating a new F<history> file, set the ownership and mode appropriately.
B<inncheck> also expects fewer things to be private to the news user.  Most
of the configuration files will never contain private information like
passwords.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.3 (2006-03-20)

=over 2

=item *

Previous versions of INN had an optimization for handling C<XHDR Newsgroups>
that used the Xref header field from overview.  While this does make
the command much faster, it doesn't produce accurate results and breaks
the NNTP protocol, so this optimization has been removed.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innd> that allowed it to accept articles with duplicated
header fields if the header field occurred an odd number of times.
Modified the programs for rebuilding overview to use the last Xref
header field if there are multiple ones to avoid problems with spools
that contain such invalid articles.

=item *

Fixed yet another problem with verifying that a user has permissions to
approve posts to a moderated group.  Thanks, Jens Schlegel.

=item *

Increase the send and receive buffer on the Unix domain socket used by
B<ctlinnd>.  This should allow longer replies (particularly for B<innstat>) on
platforms with very low default Unix domain socket buffer sizes.

=item *

B<rnews>'s handling of articles with null characters, NNTP errors, header
problems, and deferrals has been significantly improved.

=item *

Thomas Parmelan added support to B<send-uucp> for specifying the funnel or
exploder site to flush for feeds managed through one and fixed a problem
with picking up old stranded work files.

documentation fixes.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.2 (2004-12-22)

=over 2

=item *

INN is now licensed under a less restrictive license (about as minimally
restrictive as possible shy of public domain), and the clause similar to
the old BSD advertising clause has been dropped.

=item *

C<make install> and C<make update> now always install the newly built binaries,
rather than only installing them if the modification times are newer.
This is the behavior that people expect.  C<make install> now also
automatically builds a new (empty) history database if one doesn't already
exist.

=item *

The embedded Tcl filter code has been disabled (and will be removed
entirely in the next major release of INN).  It hasn't worked for some
time and causes B<innd> crashes if compiled in (even if not used).  If
someone wants to step forward and maintain it, I recommend starting from
scratch and emulating the Perl and Python filters.

=item *

B<ctlinnd> should now successfully handle messages from INN up to the maximum
allowable packet size in the protocol, fixing problems sites with many
active peers were having with B<innstat> output.

=item *

Overview generation has been fixed in both B<makehistory> and B<innd> to follow
the rules in the latest NNTP draft rather than just replacing special
characters with spaces.  This means that the unfolding of folded header
fields will not introduce additional, incorrect whitespace in the overview
data.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now uniformly responds with a C<480> or C<502> status code to attempts
to read a newsgroup to which the user does not have access, depending on
whether the user has authenticated.  Previously, it returned a C<411> status
code, claiming the group didn't exist, which confuses the reactive
authentication capability of news readers.

=item *

If a user is not authorized to approve articles (using the C<A> I<access>
control in F<readers.conf>), articles that include an Approved header field
will be rejected even if posted to unmoderated groups.  Some other site
may consider that group to be moderated.

=item *

The configuration parser used for F<readers.conf> and others now correctly
handles C<#> inside quoted strings and is more robust against unmatched
double quotes.

=item *

Messages mailed to moderators had two spaces after the colons in the
header fields, rather than one.  This bug has been fixed.

=item *

A bug that could cause heap corruption and random crashes in B<innd> if INN
were compiled with Python support has been fixed.

=item *

Some problems with B<innd>'s tracking of article size and enforcement of the
configured maximum article size have been fixed.

=item *

B<pgpverify> will now correctly verify signatures generated by GnuPG and
better supports GnuPG as the PGP implementation.

=item *

INN's code should now be more 64-bit clean in its handling of size_t,
pointer differences, and casting of pointers, correcting problems that
showed up on 64-bit platforms like AMD64.

Improved the error reporting in the history database code, in B<inews>, in
B<controlchan>, and in B<expire>.

SECURITY: Handle the special filing of control messages into per-type
newsgroups more robustly.  This closes a potentially exploitable buffer
overflow.  Thanks to Dan Riley for his excellent bug report.

=item *

Fixed article handling in B<innd> so that articles without a Path header field
(arising from peers sending incorrectly formatted articles or injecting
incorrectly formatted articles through B<rnews>) would not cause B<innd>
to crash.  (This was not exploitable.)

=item *

Fixed a serious bug in XPAT handling, thanks to Tommy van Leeuwen.

=item *

C<configure> now looks for B<sendmail> only in F</usr/sbin> and
F</usr/lib>, not on the user's path.  This should reduce the need
for B<--with-sendmail> if your preferred B<sendmail> is in a standard
location.

=item *

The robustness of the tradindexed overview method has been further
increased, handling more edge cases arising from corrupted databases and
oddly-named newsgroups.

=item *

B<innd> now never decreases the high water mark of a newsgroup when
renumbering, which should help ameliorate overview and F<active> file
synchronization problems.

=item *

Do not close and reopen the F<history> file on B<ctlinnd> reload when the
server is paused or throttled.  This was breaking B<ctlinnd> reload all during
a server pause.

=item *

Various minor portability and compilation issues fixed.  Substantial
numbers of compiler warnings have been cleaned up, thanks largely to work
by Ilya Kovalenko.

=item *

Multiple other more minor bugs have been fixed.

Documentation and man pages have been clarified and updated.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4

The F<inn.conf> parser has changed between S<INN 2.3> and 2.4.  Due to that
change, options in F<inn.conf> that contain whitespace or a few other
special characters must be quoted with double quotes, and empty parameters
(parameters with no value) are not allowed.  S<INN 2.4> comes with a script,
B<innupgrade>, run automatically during C<make update>, that will attempt
to fix any problems that it finds with your F<inn.conf> file, saving the
original as F<inn.conf.OLD>.

This change is the beginning of standardization of parsing and syntax
across all of INN's configuration files.

The history subsystem now has a standard API that allows other backends to
be used.  Because of this, you now need to specify the history method in
F<inn.conf>.  Adding:

    hismethod: hisv6

will tell INN to use the same history backend as was used in previous
versions.  B<innupgrade> should take care of this for you.

ovdb is known to have some locking and timing issues related to how B<nnrpd>
shuts down (or fails to shut down) the overview databases.  If you have
stability problems with ovdb, try setting I<readserver> to true in
F<ovdb.conf>.  This will funnel all ovdb reads through a single process
with a cleaner interface to the underlying S<Berkeley DB> database.

If you use Perl authentication for B<nnrpd> (if I<nnrpdperlauth> in
F<inn.conf> is true), there have been major changes.  See "Changes to
Perl Authentication Support for B<nnrpd>" in F<doc/hook-perl> for details.

Similarly, if you use Python authentication for B<nnrpd> (if
I<nnrpdpythonauth> in F<inn.conf> is true), there have been major changes.
See "Changes to Python Authentication and Access Control Support for
B<nnrpd>" in F<doc/hook-python> for details.

If you use B<send-uucp>, it has been completely rewritten and now takes a
configuration file to specify its behavior.  See its man page for more
information.  If you use B<sendbatch>, it is no longer included in INN
since the new B<send-uucp> can handle all of the same functionality.

The wildmat API has been renamed (to uwildmat and friends; see uwildmat(3)
for the interfaces) to distinguish it from Rich $alz's original version,
since it now supports UTF-8.  This may require changes in other software
packages that link against INN's libraries.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.3>, see L<Upgrading
from 2.2 to 2.3>.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.0 (2003-05-06)

=over 2

=item *

IPv6 support has been added, disabled by default.  If you have IPv6
connectivity, build with B<--enable-ipv6> to try it.  There are no known
bugs, but please report any problems you find (or even successes, if you
use an unusual platform).  There are a few changes of interest; further
information is available in F<doc/IPv6-info>.

=item *

The tradindexed overview method has been completely rewritten and should
be considerably more robust in the face of system crashes.  A new utility,
B<tdx-util>, is provided to examine the contents of the overview database,
repair inconsistencies, and rebuild the overview for particular groups
from a tradspool news spool.  See tdx-util(8) for more details.

=item *

The Perl and Python authentication hooks for readers have been extensively
overhauled and integrated better with F<readers.conf>.  See the Changes
sections in F<doc/hook-perl> and F<doc/hook-python> for more details.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now optionally supports article injection via IHAVE, see
readers.conf(5).  Any articles injected this way must have Date,
From, Message-ID, Newsgroups, Path, and Subject header fields.  X-Trace and
X-Complaints-To header fields will be added if the appropriate options are set
in F<readers.conf>, but other header fields will not be modified/inserted
(e.g. NNTP-Posting-Host, NNTP-Posting-Date, Organization, Lines, Cc,
Bcc, and To header fields).

=item *

B<nnrpd> now handles arbitrarily long lines in POST and IHAVE; administrators
who want to limit the length of lines in locally posted articles will need
to add this to their local filters instead.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer handles the poorly-specified S<RFC 977> optional fourth
argument to the NEWGROUPS command specifying the "distributions" that the
command was supposed to apply to.

Clients that use that argument will break.  There are not believed to be
any such clients, and it's easy enough to just filter the returned list of
newsgroups (which is generally fairly short) to achieve the same results.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer accepts UTC as a synonym for GMT for NEWGROUPS or NEWNEWS.
This usage was never portable, and was rejected by the NNTP working group.
It is being removed now in the hope that it will be caught before anyone
starts to rely on it.

=item *

B<innfeed> supports a new peer parameter, I<backlog-feed-first>, that if set
to true feeds any backlog to a peer before new articles, see
innfeed.conf(5).  When used in combination with I<max-connections> set to C<1>,
this can be used to enforce in-order delivery of messages to a peer that
is doing Xref slaving, avoiding cases where a higher-numbered message is
received before a lower-numbered message in the same group.

=item *

Several other, more minor protocol issues have been fixed: connections
rejected due to the connection rate limiting in B<innd> receive C<400> replies
instead of C<504> or C<505>, and ARTICLE without an argument will always either
retrieve the current article or return a C<423> error, never advance the
current article number to the next valid article.

See F<doc/compliance-nntp> for all of the known issues with INN's
compliance with the current NNTP draft.

=item *

All accesses to the F<history> file for all parts of INN now go through a
generic API like the storage and overview subsystems do.  This will
eventually allow new history implementations to be dropped in without
affecting the rest of INN, and will significantly improve the
encapsulation of the history subsystem.  See the libinnhist(3) man page
for the details of the interface.

=item *

INN now uses a new parser for the F<inn.conf> file.  This means that
parameters containing whitespace or other special characters must now be
quoted; see inn.conf(5).  It fixes the long-standing bug that certain
values must be included in F<inn.conf> even if using the defaults for the
use of shell or Perl scripts, and it will serve as the basis for
standardizing and cleaning up the configuration file parsing in other
parts of INN.  B<innupgrade> is run during C<make update> and should convert
an existing F<inn.conf> file for you.

=item *

B<send-uucp> has been replaced by a completely rewritten version from
Marco d'Itri, Edvard Tuinder, and Miquel van Smoorenburg, which uses a
configuration file that specifies batch sizes, compression methods, and
hours during which batches should be generated.  The old B<sendbatch>
script has been retired, since B<send-uucp> can now handle everything
that it did.

=item *

Two C<configure> options have changed names: B<--with-tmp-path> is now
B<--with-tmp-dir>, and B<--with-largefiles> is now B<--enable-largefiles>, to
improve consistency and better match the C<autoconf> option guidelines.

=item *

Variables can now be used in the F<newsfeeds> file to make it easier to
specify many similar feeds or feed patterns.  See the newsfeeds(5) man
page for details.

=item *

Local connections to INN support a new special mode, MODE CANCEL, that
allows efficient batch cancellation of messages.  This is intended to be
the preferred interface for external spam and abuse filters like NoCeM.
See "CANCEL FEEDS" in innd(8) for details.

=item *

Two new options, I<nfsreader> and I<nfswriter>, have been added to
F<inn.conf> to aid in building NFS based shared reader/writer platforms.
On the writer server, configure I<nfswriter> to true and on all of the readers,
configure I<nfsreader> to true; these options add calls to force data out to
the NFS server and force it to be read directly from the NFS server at the
appropriate moments.  Note that it has only been tested on S<Solaris 8>,
using CNFS as the storage mechanism and tradindexed as the overview
method.

=item *

A new option, I<tradindexedmmap>, has been added to F<inn.conf>.  If set
to true (the default), then the tradindexed overview method will use
C<mmap()> to access its overview data (in 2.3 you couldn't control this; it
always used mmap).

=item *

Thanks to code contributed by CMU, B<innfeed> can now feed an IMAP server as
well as other NNTP servers.  See the man page for innfeed(8) for more
information.

=item *

An authenticator, B<auth_smb>, that checks a username and password against
a remote Samba server is now included.  See auth_smb(8) for details.

=item *

The wildmat functions in INN now support UTF-8, in a way that should allow
them to still work with most simple 8-bit character sets in widespread
use.  As part of this change, some additional wildmat interfaces are now
available and the names have changed (to uwildmat, where C<u> is for
Unicode).  See uwildmat(3) for the details.

=item *

The interface between external authenticators and B<nnrpd> is now properly
documented, in F<doc/external-auth>.  A library implementing this
interface in C is provided, which should make it easier to write
additional authenticators resolvers.  See libauth(3) for details, and any
of the existing programs in F<authprogs/> for examples.

=item *

INN now checks to ensure that the configured temporary directory is
not world-writeable.  Additionally, most (if not all) of the temporary
file creation in INN now uses functions that create temporary files
properly and safely.

=item *

All of the applicable bug fixes from the S<INN 2.3> STABLE series are
also included in S<INN 2.4>.

Made CNFS more robust against crashes by actually syncing the cycbuff
headers to disk as was originally intended.

=item *

Fixed a memory leak in the tradspool code.

=item *

Two bugs in B<pgpverify> when using GnuPG were fixed: it now correctly checks

B<pgpverify> now supports using GnuPG to check signatures (rather than PGP)
without the B<pgpgpg> wrapper.  GnuPG can check both old-style RSA signatures
and new OpenPGP signatures and is recommended over S<PGP 2.6>.  If you have
GnuPG installed, B<pgpverify> will use it rather than PGP, which means that
you may have to create a new key ring for GnuPG to use to verify signatures
if you were previously using PGP.

=item *

Users can no longer post articles containing Approved header fields to
moderated groups by default; they must be specifically given that
permission with the I<access> parameter in F<readers.conf>.  See the man page

Two bugs in repacking overview index files and a reliability bug with
writing overview data were all fixed in the tradindexed overview method,
hopefully making it somewhat more reliable, particularly for B<makehistory>.

If F<rc.news.local> exists in the INN binary directory, it will be run with
the start or stop argument whenever B<rc.news> is run.  This is available

=item *

A very long-standing (since S<INN 1.0>!) NNTP protocol bug in B<nnrpd> was
fixed.  The response to an ARTICLE command retrieving a message by Message-ID

fourth.  Fixing this is reported to I<possibly> cause problems with some
Netscape browsers, but other news servers correctly follow the protocol.

Some serious performance problems with expiration of tradspool should now
be at least somewhat alleviated.  tradspool and timehash now know how to
output file names for removal rather than tokens, and B<fastrm>'s ability to
remove regular files has been restored.  This should bring expiration
times for tradspool back to within a factor of two of pre-storage-API
expiration times.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3

Simply doing a C<make update> is not sufficient to upgrade; the history and
overview information will also have to be regenerated, since the formats
of both files have changed between 2.2 and 2.3.  Regardless of whether you
were using the storage API or traditional spool under 2.2, you'll need to
rebuild your overview and history files.  You will also need to add a
F<storage.conf> file, if you weren't using the storage API under S<INN 2.2>.  A
good default F<storage.conf> file for 2.2 users would be:

    method tradspool {
        newsgroups: *
        class: 0
    }

Create this F<storage.conf> file before rebuilding history or overview.

If you want to allow readers, or if you want to expire based on newsgroup
name, you need to tell INN to generate overview data and pick an overview
method by setting I<ovmethod> in F<inn.conf>.  See F<INSTALL> and inn.conf(5)
for more details.

The code that generates the dbz index files has been split into a separate
program, B<makedbz>.  B<makehistory> still generates the base F<history> file
and the overview information, but some of its options have been changed.
To rebuild the history and overview files, use something like:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -T /usr/local/news/tmp -l 600000

(change the F</usr/local/news/tmp> path to some directory that has plenty of
temporary space, and leave off B<-O> if you're running a transit-only server
and don't intend to expire based on group name, and therefore don't need
overview.)  Or if your overview is buffindexed, use:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -F

Both will generate a new history file as F<history.n> and rebuild overview
at the same time.  If you want to preserve a record of expired Message-IDs
in the history file, run:

    awk 'NF==2 { print; }' < history >> history.n

to append them to the new history file you created above.  Look over the
new history file and make sure it looks right, then generate the new index
files and move them into place:

    makedbz -s `wc -l < history.n` -f history.n
    mv history.n history
    mv history.n.dir history.dir
    mv history.n.hash history.hash
    mv history.n.index history.index

(Rather than F<.hash> and F<.index> files, you may have a F<.pag> file if
you're using tagged hash.)

For reader machines, F<nnrp.access> has been replaced by F<readers.conf>.
There currently isn't a program to convert between the old format and the
new format (if you'd like to contribute one, it would be welcomed
gratefully).  The new file is unfortunately considerably more complex as
a result of its new capabilities; please carefully read the example
F<readers.conf> provided and the man page when setting up your initial
configuration.  The provided commented-out examples cover the most common
installation (IP-based authentication for all machines on the local
network).

INN makes extensive use of mmap(2) for the new overview mechanisms, so at
the present time NFS-mounting the spool and overview on multiple reader
machines from one central server probably isn't feasible in this version.
mmap tends to interact poorly with NFS (at the least, NFS clients won't
see updates to the mapped files in situations where they should).  (The
preferred way to fix this would, rather than backing out the use of mmap
or making it optional, to add support for Diablo-style header feeds and
pull-on-demand of articles from a master server.)

The flags for B<overchan> have changed, plus you probably don't want to
run B<overchan> at all any more.  Letting B<innd> write overview data itself
results in somewhat slower performance, but is more reliable and has a
better failure mode under high loads.  Writing overview data directly is
the default, so in a normal upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3 you'll want to comment
out or remove your B<overchan> entry in F<newsfeeds> and set I<useoverchan> to
false in F<inn.conf>.

B<crosspost> is no longer installed, and no longer works (even with
traditional spool).  If you have an entry for B<crosspost> in F<newsfeeds>,
remove it.

If you're importing a traditional spool from a pre-storage API INN server,
it's strongly recommended that you use NNTP to feed the articles to your
new server rather than trying to build overview and history directly from
the old spool.  It's more reliable and ensures that everything gets put
into the right place.  The easiest way to do this is to generate, on your
old server, a list of all of your existing article files and then feed
that list to B<innxmit>.  Further details can be found in the FAQ at
L<https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/inn.html>.

If you are using a version of Cleanfeed that still has a line in it like:

    $lines = $hdr{'__BODY__'} =~ tr/\n/\n/;

you will need to change this line to:

    $lines = $hdr{'__LINES__'};

to work with S<INN 2.3> or later.  This is due to an internal optimization of
the interface to embedded filters that's new in S<INN 2.3>.

=head1 Changes in 2.3.0 (2000-08-21)

=over 2

=item *

New F<readers.conf> file (replaces F<nnrp.access>) which allows more
flexible specification of access restrictions.  Included in the sample
implementations is a RADIUS-based authenticator.

=item *

Unified overview has been replaced with an overview API, and there are now
three separate overview implementations to choose from.  One (tradindexed)
is very like traditional overview but uses an additional index file.  The
second (buffindexed) uses large buffers rather than separate files for
each group and can handle a higher incoming article rate while still being
fast for readers.  The third (ovdb) uses S<Berkeley DB> to store overview
information (so you need to have S<Berkeley DB> installed to use it).  The
I<ovmethod> key in F<inn.conf> chooses the overview method to use.

Note that ovdb has not been as widely tested as the other overview
mechanisms and should be considered experimental.

=item *

All article storage and retrieval is now done via the storage API.
Traditional spool is now available as a storage type under the storage
API.  (Note that the current traditional spool implementation causes
nightly expire to be extremely slow for a large number of articles, so
it's not recommended that you use the tradspool storage method for the
majority of a large spool.)

=item *

The timecaf storage method has been added, similar to timehash but storing
multiple articles in a single file.  See F<INSTALL> for details on it.

=item *

INN now supports embedded Python filters as well as Perl and Tcl filters,
and supports Python authentication hooks.

=item *

There is preliminary support for news reading over SSL, using OpenSSL.

=item *

To simplify anti-abuse filtering, and to be more compliant with news
standards and proposed standards, INN now treats as control messages
only articles containing a Control header field.  A Subject header field
body beginning with C<cmsg > is no longer sufficient for a message to
be considered a control message, and the Also-Control header field is
no longer supported.

=item *

The INN build system no longer uses C<subst>.  (This will be transparent to
most users; it's an improvement and modernization of how INN is
configured.)

=item *

The build and installation system has been substantially overhauled.
C<make update> now updates scripts as well as binaries and documentation,
there is better support for parallel builds (C<make -j>), there is less
C<make> recursion, and far more of the system-dependent configuration is
handled directly by C<autoconf>.  libtool build support (including shared
library support) should be better than previous releases.

=item *

All of the applicable bug fixes from the S<INN 2.2> STABLE series are
also included in S<INN 2.3>.

=head1 Changes in 2.2.3 (2000-07-21)

=item *

INN no longer installs B<inews> setgid news or B<rnews> setuid root
by default.  If you need the old behavior, B<--enable-uucp-rnews>
and/or B<--enable-setgid-inews> must be given to C<configure>.  See
F<INSTALL> for more information.

=item *

A security hole when I<verifycancels> is turned on in F<inn.conf> (not
the default) was fixed.

=item *

Message-IDs are now limited to 250 octets to prevent interoperability
problems with other servers.

=item *

Various other security paranoia fixes have been made.

=item *

Embedded Perl filters fixed to work with S<Perl 5.6.0>.

=item *

Lots of bug fixes.

=item *

Various minor bug fixes and a Y2K bug fix.  The Y2K bug is in version
2.2.1 only and will show up after S<Jan 1st>, 2000 when a news reader
issues a NEWNEWS command for a date prior to the year 2000.

=over 2

=item *

New F<storage.conf> file (replaces F<storage.ctl>).

=item *

New (optional) way of handling non-cancel control messages (B<controlchan>)
that serializes them and prevents server overload from control message
storms.

=item *

Support for B<actsyncd> to fetch F<active> file with B<ftp>; configured
by default to use <ftp://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/active.Z> if
you run B<actsyncd>.  Be sure to read the manual page for B<actsync> to
configure an F<actsync.ign> file for your site, and test B<simpleftp>
if you do not C<configure> with B<wget> or B<ncftp>.  Also see
L<https://ftp.isc.org/pub/usenet/CONFIG/README>.

=item *

Some options to C<configure> are now moved to F<inn.conf>
(I<merge-to-groups> and I<pgp-verify>, without the hyphen).

=item *

B<inndf>, a portable version of df(1), is supplied.

=item *

New B<cnfsstat> program to show stats of CNFS buffers.

=item *

B<news2mail> and B<mailpost> programs for gatewaying news to mail and mail to
news are supplied.

=item *

B<pullnews> program for doing a sucking feed is provided (not meant for large
feeds).

The B<innshellvars.csh.in> script is obsolete (and lives in the F<obsolete>
directory, for now).
