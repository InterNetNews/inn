# The directory that overview will be stored in (the DB_HOME directory)
# is set in inn.conf with the 'pathoverview' option.  Other parameters
# for tuning ovdb are in this file.

# Compression:  if INN was compiled with zlib, and this compress
# parameter is true, ovdb will compress overview records that are
# longer than 600 bytes.  See the ovdb(5) man page for more information.
# Default is false.
#compress	false

# Size of the memory pool cache, in Kilobytes.  The cache will have a
# backing store file in the DB directory which will be at least as big.
# In general, the bigger the cache, the better.  Use 'ovdb_stat -m' to see
# cache hit percentages.  If they're less than 80%, try increasing the
# cache size.  To make a change of this parameter take effect, shut down
# and restart INN (be sure to kill all of the nnrpds when shutting down).
# Default is 8000, which is adequate for small to medium-sized servers.
# Large servers will probably need at least 14000.
#cachesize	8000

# Overview data is split between this many files.  Currently,
# innd will keep all of the files open, so don't set this too high
# or innd may run out of file descriptors.  The nnrpds only open one
# at a time, regardless.  May be set to one, or just a few, but only
# do that if your OS supports large (> 2 GB) files.  Changing this
# parameter has no effect on an already-established database.
#numdbfiles	32

# If txn_nosync is set to false, Berkeley DB flushes the log after every
# transaction.  This minimizes the number of transactions that may be
# lost in the event of a crash, but results in significantly degraded
# performance.  Default is true.
#txn_nosync	true

# If useshm is set to true, Berkeley DB will use shared memory instead
# of mmap for its environment regions (cache, lock, etc).  With some
# platforms, this may improve performance.  Default is false.
#useshm		false

# Sets the shared memory key used by Berkeley DB when 'useshm' is true.
# Berkeley DB will create several (usually 5) shared memory segments,
# using sequentially numbered keys starting with 'shmkey'.
# Choose a key that does not conflict with any existing shared memory
# segments on your system.  Default is 6400.
#shmkey		6400

# Sets the page size for the DB files (in bytes).  Must be a power of 2.
# Best choices are 4096 or 8192.  The default is 8192.
# Changing this parameter has no effect on an already-established database.
#pagesize	8192

# Sets the minimum number of keys per page.  See the Berkeley DB
# documentation for more info.  Default is based on page size:
#
#     default_minkey = MAX(2, pagesize / 2600)  if compress is false
#     default_minkey = MAX(2, pagesize / 1500)  if compress is true
#
# The lowest allowed minkey is 2.  Setting minkey higher than the
# default is not recommended, as it will cause the databases to have
# a lot of overflow pages.
# Changing this parameter has no effect on an already-established database.
#minkey		3

# Sets the Berkeley DB "lk_max" parameter, which is the maximum number
# of locks that can exist in the database at the same time.  Default
# is 4000.
#maxlocks	4000

# The nocompact parameter affects expireover's behavior.  The expireover
# function in ovdb can do its job in one of two ways:  by simply deleting
# expired records from the database; or by re-writing the overview records
# into a different location leaving out the expired records.  The first
# method is faster, but it leaves 'holes' that result in space that can
# not immediately be reused.  The second method 'compacts' the records
# by rewriting them.
# 
# If this parameter is set to 0, expireover will compact all newsgroups;
# if set to 1, expireover will not compact any newsgroups; and if set to
# a value greater than one, expireover will only compact groups that
# have less than that number of articles.  Default is 1000.
#
# Experience has shown that compacting has minimal effect (other than
# making expireover take longer) so the default is now 1.  This parameter
# will probably be removed in the future.
#nocompact	1

# Normally, each nnrpd process directly accesses the Berkeley DB environment.
# The process of attaching to the database (and detaching when finished) is
# fairly expensive, and can result in high loads in situations when there are
# lots of reader connections of relatively short duration.
# 
# When the readserver parameter is "true", the nnrpds will access overview
# via a helper server (ovdb_server -- which is started by ovdb_init).
# Default is false.
#readserver	false

# This parameter is only used when 'readserver' is true.  It sets the number
# of ovdb_server processes.  As each ovdb_server can process only one
# transaction at a time, running more servers can improve reader response
# times.  Default is 5.
#numrsprocs	5

# This parameter is only used when 'readserver' is true.  It sets a maximum
# number of readers that a given ovdb_server process will serve at one time.
# This means the maximum number of readers for all of the ovdb_server
# processes is (numrsprocs * maxrsconn).  Default is 0, which means an
# umlimited number of connections is allowed.
#maxrsconn	0
