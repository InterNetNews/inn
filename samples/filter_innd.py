##  See the INN Python Filtering and Authentication Hooks documentation

##  You have access to the following methods from the module INN:
##   - addhist(message-id)
##   - article(message-id)
##   - cancel(message-id)
##   - havehist(message-id)
##   - hashstring(string)
##   - head(message-id)
##   - newsgroup(groupname)
##   - set_filter_hook(instance)
##   - syslog(level, message)

##  The built-in intern() method has been in the sys module since Python 3.0.

##  This looks weird, but creating and interning these strings should
##  let us get faster access to header keys (which innd also interns) by
##  losing some strcmps under the covers.

##  Some of the stuff below is gratuitous, just demonstrating how the

##  what severity to use; you can abbreviate down to one letter and

##  uses, with an 'innd: python:' prefix.

##  The native Python syslog module seems to clash with INN, so use
##  INN's.  Oh yeah -- you may notice that stdout and stderr have been
##  redirected to /dev/null -- if you want to print stuff, open your
