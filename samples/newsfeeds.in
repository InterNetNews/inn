##  newsfeeds - determine where Usenet articles get sent
##
##  Format:
##	site[/exclude,exclude...]\
##		:pattern,pattern...[/distrib,distrib...]\
##		:flag,flag...\
##		:param
##
##  This file is complicated -- see newsfeeds(5) for full details.

##  The ME feed entry is special magic.
##
##  "/exclude" entries for this feed entry will cause INN to reject all
##  articles that have passed through those listed sites (by matching
##  Path: entries).  There are some "pseudo-sites" in general use that can
##  be listed as exclusions to reject specific types of 3rd-party cancel
##  messages (see the "Cancel FAQ" in news.admin.net-abuse.usenet):
##
##	cyberspam	Cancels for spam, munged articles, binaries
##	spewcancel	Cancels for munged articles and runaway gateways
##	bincancel	Cancels for binary postings to non-binary groups
##      udpcancel       Cancels to force sites to enforce antispam policies
##
##  The "pattern" field for this feed entry gives the initial subscription
##  list for all other feeds specified in this file.  These patterns are
##  *prepended* to all other feed patterns.  Using this feature is
##  confusing and mildly discouraged; make sure you understand the man
##  page before using it.
##
##  "/distrib" for this feed entry specifies what distributions the server
##  will accept.  If any distributions are listed there, the server will
##  accept only articles with those distributions.  If all the
##  distributions listed are negated (starting with !), then the server
##  will only accept articles without those distributions.
##
##  For the ME line (and the ME line *only*), patterns affect *outgoing*
##  feeds and distributions affect *incoming* feeds.

# Empty default subscription list, reject all incoming articles with a
# distribution of "local" or "collabra-internal," accept all others.
ME:!*/!local,!collabra-internal::

# The same as the above, but would reject all posts that have
# news.example.com in the path (posts passing through that site).
#ME/news.example.com:!*/!local,!collabra-internal::

# The special feed that handles all newsgroup control messages.  Only
# disable this if you want to ignore all newsgroup control messages; INN
# no longer handles any control messages except cancel internally.
controlchan!\
	:!*,control,control.*,!control.cancel\
	:Tc,Wnsm:@bindir@/controlchan

##  Uncomment if you're using innfeed.  This feed tells INN how to run
##  innfeed, and then every site you're feeding with innfeed has a
##  flag of Tm and an argument of "innfeed!" to funnel into this feed.
##  The feed pattern for innfeed should *always* be "!*"; don't ever
##  feed articles directly into innfeed.
##
##  Add "-y" as an option to innfeed to use the name of each feed as the
##  name of the host to feed articles to; without "-y" an innfeed.conf
##  file is needed.

# innfeed funnel master.
#innfeed!\
#	:!*\
#	:Tc,Wnm*:@bindir@/innfeed

##  Only uncomment this feed if both enableoverview and useoverchan are
##  set to true in inn.conf.  By default, innd will write out overview
##  internally and doesn't need or want this feed, but useoverchan can
##  optionally be set to true and this feed uncommented to move those
##  operations out of innd's main loop.

# News overview.
#overview!:*:Tc,WnteO:@bindir@/overchan


##  OUTGOING NORMAL FEED EXAMPLES

# A real-time feed through innfeed.  Don't send articles with a distribution
# of "foo", since those articles are internal.
# Note that control messages will be sent even though "!control,!control.*"
# is specified.  It is useful not to forget that pattern since control
# messages for local.* would still be sent with "*,@local.*" only.
#news.uu.net/uunet\
#	:*,!junk,!control,!control.*/!foo\
#	:Tm:innfeed!

# Create a batch file in @SPOOLDIR@/outgoing for all articles
# that haven't already passed through nic.near.net.  The batch file will
# be named nic.near.net, the default file name, and either nntpsend or
# send-nntp can send articles from that spool file.
#nic.near.net\
#	:*,!junk,!control,!control.*/!foo\
#	:Tf,Wnm:

# A UUCP feed, where we try to keep the "batching" between 4 KB and 1 KB.
# You can use send-uucp(8) to process these batch files.
#ihnp4\
#	:*,!junk,!control,!control.*/!foo\

##  OUTGOING SPECIAL FEED EXAMPLES

# Accumulate Path: header statistics.  See ninpaths(8) for more details on
# how to set this up.
#inpaths!:*:Tc,WP:@bindir@/ninpaths -p -d @LOGDIR@/path/inpaths.%d

# Feed all moderated source postings to an archiver.
#source-archive!:!*,*sources*,!*wanted*,!*.d\
#	:Tc,Wn:@bindir@/archive -f -i @SPOOLDIR@/archive/INDEX

# Feed NoCeM notices to perl-nocem in order to process third-party,
# PGP-signed article cancellation notices.  See perl-nocem(8) for more
# details on how to set this up.
#nocem!:!*,alt.nocem.misc,news.lists.filter\
#	:Tc,Wf,Ap:@bindir@/perl-nocem

# News to mail gateway.  Similar to innfeed, this uses a master feed and
# then individual feeds for every separate address that news is being
# gated to.  This sends all posts to rec.pets.redants.* to the address
# news-software@example.com.
#news2mail!:!*:Tc,Ac,Wn*:@bindir@/news2mail
#news-software@example.com:rec.pets.redants.*:Tm:news2mail!

# Capture all local postings (with a distribution of "foo" and no more
# than two sites in the Path: header) using a local program (that doesn't
# come with INN).
#capture!\
#	:*/foo\
