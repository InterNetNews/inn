##      
##  This file consists of three types of entries: key/value, peer and group.
##  Comments are taken from the hash character ``#'' to the end of the line.
##  Blank lines are ignored.
##
##  Key/value entries are a keyword immediatly followed by a colon, at least
##  one blank and a value. For example:
## 
##         max-connections: 10
## 
##  A legal key contains nor blanks, nor colon, nor ``#''.
##  There are 5 different type of  values:  integers,  booleans, and strings.
##  Integers are as to be expected. A boolean value is either ``true'' or
##  ``false'' (case is significant). A string value is any other sequence of
##  characters. If the string needs to contain whitespace, then it must be
##  quoted with double quotes.
##
##  Peer entries look like:
## 
##          peer <name> {
##               # body
##          }
## 
##  The word ``peer'' is required. <name> is a label for this peer. It is
##  any string valid as a key. The body of a peer entry contains some number
##  of key/value entries.
##
##  Group entries look like:
## 
##          group <name> {
##               # body
##          }
##
##  The word ``group'' is required. The ``<name>'' is any string valid as a
##  key. The body of a group entry contains any number of the three types of
##  entries. So key/value pairs can be defined inside a group, and peers can
##  be nested inside a group, and other groups can be nested inside a group.
##
##  Key/value entries that are defined outside of all peer and group entries
##  are said to be at ``global scope''. Global key/value entries act as
##  defaults for peers. When innd looks for a specific value in a peer entry
##  (for example, the maximum number of connections to allow), if the value
##  is not defined in the peer entry, then the enclosing groups are examined
##  for the entry (starting at the closest enclosing group). If there are no
##  enclosing groups, or the enclosing groups don't define the key/value,
##  then the value at global scope is used.
##
##  A small example could be:
## 
##      # Global value applied to all peers that have no value of their own.
##      max-connections: 5
## 
##      # A peer definition.
##      peer uunet {
##           hostname: usenet1.uu.net
##      }
## 
##      peer vixie {
##              hostname: gw.home.vix.com
##              max-connections: 10      # override global value.
##      }
## 
##      # A group of two peers who can open more connections than normal
##      group fast-sites {
##           max-connections: 15
## 
##           # Another peer. The ``max-connections'' value from the
##           # ``fast-sites'' group scope is used.
##           peer data.ramona.vix.com {
##                hostname: data.ramona.vix.com
##           }
## 
##           peer bb.home.vix.com {
##                hostname: bb.home.vix.com
##                max-connections: 20 # he can really cook.
##           }
##      }
## 
##  Given the above configuration file, the defined peers would have the
##  following values for the ``max-connections'' key.
##
##          uunet                  5
##          vixie                 10
##          data.ramona.vix.com   15
##          bb.home.vix.com       20
##
##  Height keys are allowed:
##
##  hostname:
##   This key is mandatory in a peer block. The value is a string representing
##   a list of hostnames separated by a comma. A hostname is the host's FQDN,
##   or the dotted quad ip-address of the peer.
##
##  streaming:
##   This key requires a boolean value. It defines whether streaming commands
##   are allowed from this peer. (default=true)
##
##  max-connections:
##   This key requires positive integer value. It defines the maximum number
##   of connections allowed. A value of zero specifies an unlimited number
##   of maximum connections (``unlimited'' or ``none'' can be used as synonym).
##   (default=0)
## 
##  hold-time:
##   This key requires positive integer value. It defines the hold time before
##   close, if the connection is over max-connections. A value of zero
##   specifies immediate close. (default=0)
##
##  password:
##   This key requires a string value. It is used if you wish to require a peer
##   to supply a password. (default=no password)
##
##  patterns:
##   This key requires a string value. It is a list of newsfeeds(5)-style list
##   of newsgroups which are to be accepted from this host. (default="*")
##
##  email:
##   This key requires a string value. Reserved for future use. (default=empty)
##
##  comment:
##   This key requires a string value. Reserved for future use. (default=empty)
##
##  skip:
##   This key requires a boolean value. Setting this entry causes this peer
##   to be skipped. Reserved for future use. (default=false)
##
##  noresendid: 
##   This key requires a boolean value. It defines whether innd should send
##   "431 RESENDID" (stream mode) or "436 Retry later" (non-stream mode)
##   responses if a message is offered that is already received from another
##   peer. This can be useful for peers that resend messages right away,
##   as innfeed does. (default=false)
##

streaming:              true   # streaming allowed by default
max-connections:        8      # per feed

peer ME {
  hostname:         "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1"
