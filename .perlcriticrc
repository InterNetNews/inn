# Configuration for perlcritic source code analysis.  -*- conf -*-
#
# Many of the Perl::Critic policies are excellent starting points for new code
# so as to directly enforce conventional, easier to read and modern constructs.
# However, as most of the Perl INN code base predates the use of Perl::Critic,
# and given that the policies are mostly just style and not about actual bugs,
# many exclusions are listed in this configuration file.
#
# The idea is to progressively treat the violations while modernizing or
# modifying parts of existing Perl code, and to write new code following most
# of these best practices.  Some exceptions will naturally keep existing as
# Perl::Critic is not intended to be used as rigid rules, and fully complying
# to all the policies is probably not practical (and even sometimes in conflict
# with the Perl::Tidy reformatter).
#
# Existing code is kept untouched, and has just been quickly reviewed when
# excluding the policies below to ensure there were not any real bugs to fix.
#
