/*
**  wildmat pattern matching with Unicode UTF-8 extensions.
**
**  Do shell-style pattern matching for ?, \, [], and * characters.  Might not
**  be robust in face of malformed patterns; e.g., "foo[a-" could cause a
**  segmentation violation.  It is 8-bit clean.  (Robustness hopefully fixed
**  July 2000; all malformed patterns should now just fail to match anything.)
**
**  Original by Rich $alz, mirror!rs, Wed Nov 26 19:03:17 EST 1986.
**  Rich $alz is now <rsalz@osf.org>.
**
**  April, 1991: Replaced mutually-recursive calls with in-line code for the
**  star character.
**
**  Special thanks to Lars Mathiesen <thorinn@diku.dk> for the ABORT code.
**  This can greatly speed up failing wildcard patterns.  For example:
**
**    pattern: -*-*-*-*-*-*-12-*-*-*-m-*-*-*
**    text 1: -adobe-courier-bold-o-normal--12-120-75-75-m-70-iso8859-1
**    text 2: -adobe-courier-bold-o-normal--12-120-75-75-X-70-iso8859-1
**
**  Text 1 matches with 51 calls, while text 2 fails with 54 calls.  Without
**  the ABORT code, it takes 22310 calls to fail.  Ugh.  The following
**  explanation is from Lars:
**
**  The precondition that must be fulfilled is that match_pattern will consume
**  at least one character in text.  (This is true if *p is neither '*' nor
**  '\0'.)  The last return has ABORT instead of false to avoid quadratic
**  behaviour in cases like pattern "*a*b*c*d" with text "abcxxxxx".
**  With false, each star-loop has to run to the end of the text; with ABORT
**  only the last one does.
**
**  Once the control of one instance of match_pattern enters the star-loop,
**  that instance will return either true or ABORT, and any calling instance
**  will therefore return immediately after (without calling recursively
**  again).  In effect, only one star-loop is ever active.  It would be
**  possible to modify the code to maintain this context explicitly,
**  eliminating all recursive calls at the cost of some complication and loss
**  of clarity (and the ABORT stuff seems to be unclear enough by itself).
**  I think it would be unwise to try to get this into a released version
**  unless you have a good test data base to try it out on.
**
**  June, 1991: Robert Elz <kre@munnari.oz.au> added minus and close bracket
**  handling for character sets.
**
**  July, 2000: Largely rewritten by Russ Allbery <eagle@eyrie.org> to add
**  support for ',', '!', and optionally '@' to the core wildmat routine.
**  Broke the character class matching into a separate function for clarity
**  since it's infrequently used in practice, and added some simple lookahead
**  to significantly decrease the recursive calls in the '*' matching code.
**  Added support for UTF-8 as the default character set for any high-bit
**  characters.
**
**  For more information on UTF-8, see RFC 3629.
**
**  Please note that this file is intentionally written so that conditionally
**  executed expressions are on separate lines from the condition to
**  facilitate analysis of the coverage of the test suite using purecov.
**  Please preserve this.  As of March 11, 2001, purecov reports that the
**  accompanying test suite achieves 100% coverage of this file.
