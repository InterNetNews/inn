/*
 * Concatenate strings with dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *      string = concat(string1, string2, ..., (char *) 0);
 *      path = concatpath(base, name);
 *
 * Dynamically allocates (using xmalloc) sufficient memory to hold all of the
 * strings given and then concatenates them together into that allocated
 * memory, returning a pointer to it.  Caller is responsible for freeing.
 * Assumes xmalloc is available.  The last argument must be a null pointer (to
 * a char *, if you actually find a platform where it matters).
 *
 * concatpath is similar, except that it only takes two arguments.  If the
 * second argument begins with / or ./, a copy of it is returned; otherwise,
 * the first argument, a slash, and the second argument are concatenated
 * together and returned.  This is useful for building file names where names
 * that aren't fully qualified are qualified with some particular directory.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file *used to be* maintained in the
 * rra-c-util package, which can be found at
 * <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
