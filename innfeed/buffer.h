/*
**  The public interface to the Buffer class.
**
**  Written by James Brister <brister@vix.com>
**
**  The Buffer class encapsulates a region of memory. It provides reference
**  counting so that redundant memory allocation and copying is minimized. A
**  good example of this is the need to write the same data (e.g. an article
**  body) out more than one socket. The data is stored in a Buffer and the
**  Buffer is given to each EndPoint that is to write it. With the Refcount
**  appropriately set the EndPoints can release their references at will and
**  the Buffer will be cleaned up when necessary.
