/*
**  The public interface to the Host class.
**
**  Written by James Brister <brister@vix.com>
**
**  The Host class represents the remote news system that we're feeding.  A
**  Host object has possibly multiple connections to the remote system which
**  it sends articles down.  It is given the articles by other objects
**  (typically the InnListener), and once taken it assumes all responsibility
**  for transmission or temporary storage on network failures etc.

/*
 * Create a new Host object.
 *
 * NAME is the name that INN uses.
 * IPNAME is the name the networking code uses (or the ascii dotted quad
 *    IP address).
 * ARTTIMEOUT is the max amount of time we'll wait for a new article
 *    from INN before considering the connection unused and we'll close
 *    down.
 * RESPTIMEOUT is the max amount of time we'll wait for any response
 *    from a remote. Past this we'll close down the network connection.
 * INITIALCXNS is the number of Connections to create at Host creation time.
 * MAXCXNS is the maximum number of parallel connections to the
 *    remote host we can run at any one time.
 * MAXCHECK is the maximum number of nntp CHECK commands to be outstanding
 *    on a connection before opening up a new connection (or refusing
 *    new articles if we get to MAXCXNS).
 * PORTNUM is the port number on the remote host we should talk to.
 * CLOSEPERIOD is the number of seconds after connecting that the
 *     connections should be closed down and reinitialized (due to problems
 *     with old NNTP servers that hold history files open. Value of 0 means
 *     don't close down.
 * STREAMING is a boolean flag to tell if the Host wants its Connections to
 *     do streaming or not.
 * LOWPASSHIGH is the high value for the low-pass filter.
 * LOWPASSLOW is the low value for the low-pass filter.
