/*
**  The public interface to the Connection class.
**
**  Written by James Brister <brister@vix.com>
**
**  The Connection class encapulates an NNTP protocol endpoint (either regular
**  or extended with the streaming protocol).  Each Connection is owned by a
**  single Host object.
**
**  It manages the network connection (via an EndPoint) and the pumping of
**  articles to the remote host.  It gets these articles from its Host object.
**  If the remote doesn't handle the streaming extension, then the Connection
**  will only manage one article at a time.  If the remote handles the
**  extension, then the connection will queue up articles while sending the
**  CHECK and TAKETHIS commands.
**
**  If the network connection drops while the Connection object has articles
**  queued up, then it will hand them back to its Host object.
